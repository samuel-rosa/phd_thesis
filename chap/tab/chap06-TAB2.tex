 \texttt{GEO\_50a} & \textit{SG-I}. Inferior Sequence of the Serra Geral Formation. Composed mainly of basic 
 igneous rocks (tholeiitic basalt and andesite). It is likely to be related with high CLAY and ECEC. \NN
 \texttt{GEO\_50b} & \textit{SG-S}. Superior Sequence of the Serra Geral Formation. Composed mainly of acid 
 igneous rocks (granophyric rhyolite and rhyodacite). It is likely to be related with moderate to high CLAY 
 and ECEC. \NN
 \texttt{GEO\_50c} & \textit{BT}. Botucatu Formation. Composed mainly of aeolian sandstones. It is likely to 
 be related with low CLAY and ECEC. \NN
 Other & \textit{CT} depicts the Caturrita Formation, which is composed mainly of fluvial sandstones. \NN
