\chapter{GENERAL CONCLUSION}
\label{chap:chap10}

This thesis has made a local pedological contribution with the development of a comprehensive description of 
the soil-forming factors and processes that determine the spatio-temporal distribution of soil properties of 
the study site where the study cases were conducted. The conceptual model of pedogenesis, presented in 
\autoref{chap:chap03}, showed that the spatial distribution of soil properties is highly variable, even when 
under the same land use. At large spatial scales, this spatial variation is determined by the geological and 
geomorphological diversity of the area, while at small spatial scales, past and current (poor) agricultural 
practices seem to play a major role. Along with the conceptual model of pedogenesis, \autoref{chap:chap04} and 
\autoref{chap:chap05} constitute a technical contribution of this thesis. These chapters provide the bases for 
future soil spatial modelling exercises in the study site.

\autoref{chap:chap06} has demonstrated that the existing, freely available covariates are suitable for 
calibrating soil spatial models. It was shown that using more detailed covariates results in only a modest 
increase in the prediction accuracy of linear soil spatial models. The observed increase is comparable to the 
effect of incorporating spatial dependence in the soil spatial model, and may not outweigh the extra costs of 
using more detailed covariates. In general, a more detailed covariate has a greater potential to improve 
prediction accuracy when a soil property is poorly predicted by its less detailed version. However, the 
magnitude of the improvement may depend on which other covariates are included in the model. Choosing whether 
or not to invest in more detailed covariates depends on the strength of the relationship between the 
covariates and the soil property being modelled, and on the relative difference between the less, and 
more detailed versions of the covariates. It is likely better to substantially improve the detail of a 
less influential covariate than marginally increase the detail of the most influential covariate. However, one 
should always consider if more efficient means of increasing prediction accuracy exist (e.g. obtaining more 
soil observations).

\autoref{chap:chap07} showed that several factors influence how field soil spatial modellers decide upon where 
to place soil observation locations. These are of three types: conceptual, operational, and psychological. The 
first concerns the knowledge of the soil spatial modellers about soil-landscape relationships, and seems to be 
connected with the years of field experience. The second relates to the available resources (infrastructure, 
workforce, and budget) to make soil observations, as well as to access restrictions imposed by landowners and 
geographic barriers, for example. The third relates with how the soil modellers perceive their surrounding 
physical environment and how the course of their motivation shifts during the soil observation process. Point 
pattern analysis helped understanding that there is a trade-off between conceptual and operational factors, 
which determines how the motivation of field soil modellers shifts focus towards one or another immediate 
goal. 
Depending on the focal goal, the resulting sample configuration resembles a random (learning/verifying 
soil-landscape relationships -- means-focused motivation) or a regular (maximizing the number of observations 
and geographic coverage -- outcome-focused motivation) point pattern.

\autoref{chap:chap08} showed that the conditioned Latin hypercube sampling algorithm, a popular algorithm
used to optimize spatial sample configurations for spatial trend estimation, can be considerably improved. 
Compared to the original implementation, the proposed improvements resulted in a sampling algorithm 
with a better numerical behaviour. Preliminary results showed that the improvements on the algorithm 
resulted in more accurate and precise spatial predictions. Apparently, only taking the association/correlation 
between 
covariates into account degrades prediction accuracy because the coverage of the geographic space is poorer. 
As such, when optimizing a sample configuration for spatial trend estimation, it should suffice to aim only at 
reproducing the marginal distribution of the covariates. This should be done using only the non-empty 
marginal sampling strata.

Finally, this thesis has contributed with two packages for the software environment for statistical computing 
and graphics \texttt{R}. The first package, called \texttt{pedometrics}, contains miscellaneous functions 
designed for the development of this thesis. The second package, called \texttt{spsann}, contains functions to 
optimize sample configurations to identify and estimate the variogram and spatial trend, and make spatial 
predictions. The latter was developed as part of \autoref{chap:chap08} and \autoref{chap:chap09}. Both are 
freely available and can be obtained from The Comprehensive R Archive Network (\cran).
