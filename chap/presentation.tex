\chapter*{Preface}

I was never sure about what a thesis should consist of: I worked on so many things during the four years of 
my doctorate course that I found myself somewhat lost when I had to decide what to write in the thesis. There 
are official documents suggesting \emph{how} the thesis should be written, but not exactly \emph{what} should 
be written -- I find the definitions somewhat vague. For example, the manual of our university states that a 
\q{thesis consists of the result of a research which is presented as the final requirement for the completion 
of a doctorate course}\footnote{\citeonline{UFRRJ2006}}, which is quite the same thing said by the 
International Organization for Standardization (\iso): a \q{document which presents the author's research and 
findings and submitted by him in support of his candidature for a degree or professional 
qualification}\footnote{\citeonline{ISO1986}}. I tried reading other theses to see if I could get an 
inspiration. I also discussed this matter with my patient supervisors Lúcia Helena Cunha dos Anjos 
(Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), Gustavo de Mattos Vasques (Embrapa Solos, Brazil), and 
Gerard B. M. Heuvelink (ISRIC -- World Soil Information, the Netherlands). Unfortunately, for one reason or 
another, I was never satisfied with the outcome.

At first, I was a bit desperate. Have I failed? Has everyone failed? I hoped not! Perhaps the lack of an 
objective, ultimate, universal definition of what a thesis should consist of meant that, as a doctorate 
student, it was my responsibility to construct such a definition. This idea gave me back the long-lost 
excitement to write my thesis. I did not want to follow a boring ritual. I wanted to have fun and be 
completely honest with the reader, as Richard Webster\footnote{\citeonline{Webster2003}} had once suggested. 
As such, I started thinking about all steps given since the start of the doctorate course, something like 
\q{Once upon a time in Seropédica...}.

As the title says, this thesis is about a research on some of the sources of uncertainty in soil spatial 
models, i.e. some of the factors determining a soil map to be more or less accurate. Many of these sources are 
known, others are still unknown, and some are disregarded due to our ignorance -- or by convenience. When I 
wrote my doctorate research project, it seemed appropriate to aim at evaluating what I understood as being the 
main sources of uncertainty in soil spatial modelling. The reason was simple: soil spatial modelling was a 
growing activity in Brazilian universities and research centres, and I felt that many soil spatial modellers 
were inclined towards using the most expensive data sources as the only way of producing higher accuracy soil 
maps of the Brazilian territory. I was preoccupied about these ideas -- which appeared to be sort of an 
euphoria about new remote sensors -- because I believed that high quality soil maps could be produced if we 
simply started using the data at hand.

Defining the main sources of uncertainty in soil spatial modelling required an operational definition, which 
was given based on the observation that, in general, the main decisions made by soil spatial modellers concern 
the a) calibration observations, b) covariates, and c) model structure. The general objective of evaluating 
these three mains sources of uncertainty was then divided into five specific objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify appropriate calibration sample sizes and designs for soil spatial modelling;

\item Determine the accuracy of freely available covariates and their suitability to calibrate soil spatial
models;

\item Identify appropriate covariate selection methods to build linear soil spatial models;

\item Assess the effect of multicollinearity among covariates on the performance of linear soil spatial 
models;

\item Identify database scenarios in which non-linear soil spatial models are more efficient than linear soil 
spatial models.
\end{enumerate}

The idea was to deal with each of the objectives separately and present the results in individual chapters of 
the thesis which would be submitted for publication in peer reviewed journals. The main expected result was the 
definition of a sound \emph{working protocol} that would allow the construction of efficient soil spatial 
models. My goal was to contribute to national (Brazilian Research Network on Digital Soil Mapping -- \redemds) 
and international (\globalsoilmap{} and Global Soil Information Facilities -- \gsif) initiatives, while 
generating a significant amount of bibliographic material to support the teaching of modern soil spatial 
modelling techniques in soil classes at Brazilian universities.

class that I have adapted to compile this thesis is available in 
\href{https://github.com/samuel-rosa/UFRuralRJ}{GitHub}.}

With time it became clear that the five objectives and the expected results were too ambitious. I certainly 
was overwhelmed by the knowledge of the multiple sources of uncertainty, and felt compelled to develop a very 
through study. But I forgot that a doctorate course includes more activities than those planed in the 
research project: you take classes, prepare grant proposals, write reports, help colleagues, get involved in 
other projects -- such as adapting the \LaTeX{}\footnote{\footlatex} class used to compile this thesis --, 
publish the papers of your master thesis, train undergraduate students, create and maintain the newsletter of 
a scientific group, read many articles and books, learn a couple of computer languages, start a relationship, 
get sick, and so on. When you see, two years are already gone by, and you still are preparing the database with 
which you will develop your case studies.

\def\footr{See more about \texttt{R} in 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_\%28programming_language\%29}{Wikipedia}}

I know that I was particularly lucky for most of the soil and covariate data already being available for my 
use -- I have decided very early to continue using the data that I collected during my master course. However, 
I spent a lot of time to organize it and make a through description of all processing steps before I could 
actually use it. This effort was in line with my original intent of defining a working protocol for 
constructing soil spatial models. Meeting this goal required making my research the most reproducible as 
possible. I then learned that many well known methods of data analysis/processing are not used simply because 
they are not implemented in a (single) software package. Developing and maintaining a software package in the 
most popular environment for data processing and analysis, i.e. \texttt{R}\footnote{\footr}, was a natural 
decision: programming took a lot of my time.

A significant amount of time was also spent preparing a description of the soil-forming factors and processes
that determine the soil spatio-temporal distribution in the study area where the case studies were to be 
developed. Such a description is called in this thesis a \emph{conceptual model of pedogenesis}. This was 
another effort in line with the definition of a working protocol. But it was also expected to serve the 
development of a experiment devoted to meeting the third objective of the research project. My intent was to 
compare automated covariate selection methods with the use of expert knowledge. Preliminary tests were 
conducted with a few experts to help planning the experiment, which was believed to be a complex one. But 
since I needed to give more attention to the first and second objectives, I had to stop working on the third 
objective.

There also was my poor knowledge on some known topics, which sometimes took me to the wrong direction. For 
example, I wanted to evaluate how much more accurate a soil map is when more accurate covariates are used 
(second objective), the reason being that I was concern with the fact that the covariates too are in error. As 
such, I collected field data to validate the covariates and correct them for any systematic errors. Only later, 
discussing with Gerard, I understood that 1) the validation data was poor, and 2) in soil spatial modelling the 
covariates generally are assumed to be measured without error -- otherwise a technique called error propagation 
analysis (or uncertainty analysis) is employed to take that error into account. In the end, we had to 
reformulate the second objective of the research project.

Devising an experiment to evaluate the influence of sample size and design on the accuracy of soil maps also 
was a challenge. Most soil data used for soil spatial modelling was produced in the past century (legacy data) 
with observation locations purposively selected by soil spatial modellers using tacit rules. As such, I wanted 
to build an algorithm composed of a set of objective decision rules that would produce spatial samples similar 
to those produced by a soil spatial modeller. I would then simulate budget scenarios for sampling and see how 
different spatial sample would perform regarding soil map accuracy. But how to devise such an algorithm? I 
interviewed the soil spatial modellers that produced the soil data used in the doctorate research project, 
carried out a point pattern analysis of the resulting spatial sample configuration, and explored psychological 
concepts to understand the whys of the locations of the sampling points. A lengthy study was carried out 
without finding a practical solution. Perhaps it was more appropriate to explore the existing, less complex 
algorithms that produce spatial samples using more objective decision rules.

\def\foottravel{See about the \emph{travelling salesman problem} at 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem}{Wikipedia}.}

We then invited Dick Brus (Alterra, the Netherlands) to participate devising the experiment to evaluate the 
influence of sample size and design on the accuracy of soil maps. After some talks and a bibliographic review, 
we decided for using sampling algorithms that are based on the so-called spatial simulated annealing which are 
commonly used to produce spatial samples for soil spatial modelling. Having decided the sampling algorithm to 
work with, we needed to choose a sound method to take sampling costs into account. Because the access time to 
sampling points usually is the major cost component in soil sampling, Gerard and I thought of building an 
algorithm to solve the problem of travelling from one sampling point to the next with the least 
cost\footnote{\foottravel}. This would be a good piece of work, but we soon realized that solving the 
travelling problem was impossible given the available resources.

After some time working on the sampling experiment, we came to learn that the sampling algorithms that we had 
chosen had weaknesses -- apparently like any algorithm. So, we thought that, perhaps, we could improve on 
those algorithms! A literature review suggested that we were correct and there was room for algorithmic 
improvements. But now we needed to know if the algorithmic improvements had any practical added value before 
evaluating the influence of sample size and design. Another change in the schedule was needed: I pointed that 
two experiments should be carried out, the first to evaluate the algorithmic improvements, the second to 
compare the algorithms. At this point it became clear that carrying out the experiment to evaluate covariate 
selection methods was impossible given the time available till the end of the doctorate course. This was a pity 
because I had already visited Murray Lark at the the British Geological Survey (\bgs) headquarters in 
Nottingham, UK, to discuss about the experiment.

Like it happened with the third objective, there was not enough time to conduct experiments to meet the fourth 
and fifth objectives. I think the topic of the fourth objective is a very important one, directly related 
with the problem of selecting the covariates, which I really wanted to deal with in my thesis. I would have 
been very happy if I could discuss the topic at least partially, but perhaps partial solutions may not be very 
useful. As for the fifth objective, I believe that developing a sound globally relevant work on the topic 
requires using several datasets, not a single dataset as I explored in my research project.

As a consequence of all these events, at the end on the doctorate course, I must confess that I was able 
to meet only the first and scratch the surface of the second scientific objectives of my doctorate research 
project. I did make \emph{technical} contributions that were part of the original goal of defining a working 
protocol for soil spatial modelling. This includes documenting the soil and covariate data, as well as their 
processing steps, and describing the soil-forming factors that determine the soil spatio-temporal distribution 
in the study area. However, these technical contributions do not help meeting any of the original scientific 
objectives. The same applies to the two \texttt{R}-packages that I developed and maintained, and the experiment 
conducted to understand how soil spatial modellers decide upon where to observe the soil, which were not 
originally planned in the research project.

So... This is, more or less, the \emph{story} of the research that I have carried out in collaboration with my 
supervisors and co-authors during my doctorate course. Perhaps I should be happy for this story having more 
errors than hits -- because I learned more with the former than with the last. I guess this is it: there is 
nothing to write in this thesis other than what I have done during the doctorate course that is directly and/or 
indirectly related to the original research project, have it been planned or not, be it a technical or 
scientific contribution, completed or not. This is what I present as the final requirement for the completion 
of the doctorate course.

I do hope that my supervisors and co-authors like the work that I have done in the past four years. Lúcia, 
Gustavo, Gerard, and Dick have been so patient, so understanding, so respectful, that I have no words to 
prepare the deserved thanks. Each one of them with a different background, a different life story, a different 
perspective, working in a different part of the world... I learned a lot with them: soil science, mathematics, 
statistics, informatics, English, politics and science, human relations, and much more. What a pleasure 
experience working with the four of you!

I also hope that the outcome of my doctorate research is of interest for the supporting institutions, simply 
because I would never be writing this preface without their support. These are:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, through the Post-Graduate Course in Agronomy-Soil Science
 and Department of Soil Science, for providing a solid soil science education, unconditionally supporting my 
 research, and finding the means to guarantee my participation in several international events;
 
 \item Ministry of Science and Technology of Brazil, through the CNPq Foundation (Process 140720/2012-0), that
 provided a three-year grant without which I would not be able to develop any research at all;
 
 \item Ministry of Education of Brazil, through the CAPES Foundation (Process ID BEX 11677/13-9), that funded
 my one-year stay in the Netherlands, where most of the research was actually developed;
 
 \item Wageningen University and Research Centre, through ISRIC -- World Soil Information, for unconditionally
 supporting my research.
 
 \item Embrapa Soils, for supporting my research.
 
 \item Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, through the Department of Soil Science, for supporting my research.
\end{itemize}

It is needed to note that six individuals gave important technical contributions during the preparation of 
the soil and covariate data that were used to develop the case studies. Three of them are from the Universidade 
Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro: Fabio Paes Leme Ferreira, Anastácia Perci Campos de Almeida, and Mauro Antônio 
Homem Antunes. The other three are from the Universidade Federal de Santa Maria: Ricardo Simão Diniz Dalmolin, 
Jean Michel Moura Bueno, and Luis Fernando Chimelo Ruiz.

Many other individuals have also given some form of scientific and/or technical contribution, be it through 
the exchange of e-mail massages, chatting during a coffee break, a short visit to their home institutions, or 
any other informal occasion. Their contributions were invaluable for usually raising unforeseen questions, 
pointing to extremely helpful references, and helping me seeing the research problems from another perspective.
Special thanks are due to Ad van Oostrum, Andreas Jürg Papritz, Bas Kempen, Bradley A. Miller, Chantal 
Hendriks, Dominique Arrouays, Edgardo Ramos Medeiros, Eloi Carvalho Ribeiro, Jorge Mendes de Jesus, Madlene 
Nussbaum, Marcos Angelini, Murray Lark, Nicolas Saby, Pablo Miguel, Pedro de Souza Calegaro, Richard Webster, 
Thomas Caspari, Tomislav Hengl, Vera Laetitia Mulder, and many others that I might have forgotten.

Having the story of a doctorate course to tell depends not only on scientific and/or technical contributions,
but also on the unconditional support of family, friends, and colleagues. My family, which gained several new 
members in the last four years, was strong enough to understand my rare and short visits, and the importance of 
a long stay on the other side of the Atlantic. Although my mother (Elaine), father (Adir), and brother 
(Eduardo) have only a vague idea of what I have been working on, their support was incommensurable. 
South-American and European friends were invaluable: Marcos, Indira, Eloi, Thomas, Nina, Jorge, André, Thiago, 
and Andriéli. There was the amazing, coolest of them all, ISRIC family, which I miss very much, lead by 
our dearest Yolanda. There also were my post-graduate colleagues. But one friend deserves a special thank: 
Manoeli! Thank you Manoeli -- by destiny or a strange coincidence --, born and raised in the same small town, 
after completing the bachelor and master together in Brazil, we ended up sharing the same house in The 
Netherlands during the doctorate. There, we continued our philosophical chats about all aspects of life, the 
universe, and everything which we started years ago. It was a pleasure to share a full year with such a 
wonderful friend!

Finally, three little Baconian creatures, one having only a vague idea of my work, the other two not speaking 
any human language, deserve my most sincere thank: Monique, Tupã, and Dindi! Your love is fire through my 
veins!
