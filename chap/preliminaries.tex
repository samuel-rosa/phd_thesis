 \item[Covariate] Covariates are used in quantitative spatial soil modelling because they are 
 proxies of soil-forming factors. For example, they provide information about topography, 
 vegetation, land use, geology, soil parent material, climate, soil itself and other 
 intimately-associated surface conditions.
 
 \item[Spatial detail] The level of spatial detail of covariate data is defined based on the data 
 sources and/or production methods, which demand different amounts of resources (time, workforce, 
 budget, technology, and so on). Specifically, the level of spatial detail of a covariate is a 
 function of the components of its production process such as the cartographic ratio, spatial 
 sampling support, number and diversity of data sources explored, and quantity of spatial data used. 
 This definition of spatial detail is broader than that of spatial resolution or spatial scale, and 
 should not be confounded with spatial support \cite{WebsterEtAl2007} or thematic detail 
 \cite{Rossiter2000}.
