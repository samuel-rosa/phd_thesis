  Abstract                 = {Key assumptions that underlie the application of standard generalized linear models (GLMs) include the statistical independence of the observations, the correct specification of the link and variance functions, the correct scale for measurement of the explanatory variables and the lack of undue in uence of individual observations on the tted model.. Using data on counts of epileptic seizures before and after treatment (Thall and Vail, 1990) for illustration, this paper reviews methods that may be applied after tting a GLM to detect departures from the key assumptions and to make valid inferences even in the face of them. Problems of overdispersion may be resolved by recourse to the jackknife, the bootstrap or the \sandwich" standard error estimates, for example, as well as by tting of models with parameters in the variance function. Many of the techniques are easily implemented in the S statistical language by calling routines already developed for linear model analysis.},

We describe a flexible class of space-time point processes. Our models are Cox processes whose stochastic intensity is a space-time Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We develop moment-based methods of parameter estimation, show how to predict the underlying intensity by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and illustrate the performance of our methods on a synthetic data set.},

  Abstract                 = {In estimating spatial means of environmental variables of a region from data collected by convenience or purposive sampling, validity of the results can be ensured by collecting additional data through probability sampling. The precision of the pi estimator that uses the probability sample can be increased by interpolating the values at the nonprobability sample points to the probability sample points, and using these interpolated values as an auxiliary variable in the difference or regression estimator. These estimators are (approximately) unbiased, even when the nonprobability sample is severely biased such as in preferential samples. The gain in precision compared to the pi estimator in combination with Simple Random Sampling is controlled by the correlation between the target variable and interpolated variable. This correlation is determined by the size (density) and spatial coverage of the nonprobability sample, and the spatial continuity of the target variable. In a case study the average ratio of the variances of the simple regression estimator and pi estimator was 0.68 for preferential samples of size 150 with moderate spatial clustering, and 0.80 for preferential samples of similar size with strong spatial clustering. In the latter case the simple regression estimator was substantially more precise than the simple difference estimator.},

  Review                   = {SCALE AS OUR WINDOW OF PERCEPTION. Levin1992 stated that the “scale represents the window of perception, the filter or the measuring tool through which a landscape may be viewed or perceived”. As such, scale related concepts (see DunganEtAl2002) apply to the technology that we use to produce observations of the landscape features and of the processes that created those features. Landscape features and processes do not have a "scale" or "resolution" per se. When we say that a landscape feature or a process have a "scale" we simply are defining our "window of perception". This means that whatever we mean by landscape feature or process is directly dependent of our "window of perception". THE OPTIMUM SCALE. The "optimum scale" or "optimum resolution" has always been defined based on maximizing the correlation between the environmental covariate and the soil property being mapped. Since the soil property data is available at a very limited number of locations, the "optimum" is a "conditional optimum". It does not necessarily is the "optimum scale" or "optimum resolution" to provide an explanation of a pedogenetic process. Besides, finding the "optimum resolution" does not mean that the most accurate predictions will be made, but only that there is a resolution at with the correlation between the environmental covariate and the soil property data is maximum. Several studies (see the many studies of Thorsten Behrens) have shown that the best performing models are those build using "multiple-scale" covariates. COVARIATES AS PROXIES OF THE DRIVERS OF PEDOGENETIC PROCESSES. Environmental covariates seem to be much more correlated with system conditions or state factors or state conditions - the "drivers" of the pedogenetic processes, than to the pedogenetic processes themselves. Environmental covariates are proxies of the state factors. They are approximate models of the spatial patterns of land surface features. As such, they are simple indicators of the potential of a given process to take or to have taken place. They do not "reflect geomorphic, climatic and hydrologic processes" as suggested by McKenzieEtAl1999.},

  Abstract                 = {Landscape position is a critical factor influencing many co-varying soil properties even in highly weathered soils that tend to have a high degree of homogeneity. The objective of this study was to learn how the position of a soil in a toposequence influences soil color, mineralogy, and some chemical and physical properties. In a toposequence of Oxisols developed from basalt in the Central Plateau of Brazil (Goias State), moist soil color changed from dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) in upper slope positions to dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) in lower slope positions and the following trends were observed: hematite content decreased and goethite content increased, the amount of Al substitution in the goethite structure increased, gibbsite content decreased and kaolinite content increased, and magnetic suceptibility and maghemite content of fine clay decreased. Also, the yellower soils down slope adsorbed more P and desorbed less P than the redder soils upslope, possibly because the yellower soils contain more goethite, which was found to have a smaller crystallite size and more DCB-extractable Al than hematite. Soil color is a reliable indicator of iron oxide mineralogy which reflects the genesis of the soil and influences properties that affect plant growth. Thus, color should be used at a relatively high categorical level in soil classification systems to define classes of Latosols and Oxisols.},

  Abstract                 = {Persulfate oxidation was validated as a method to predict polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bioavailability in soils and sediments. It was demonstrated for 14 field contaminated soils and sediments that residual PAH concentrations after a short (3 h) persulfate oxidation correspond well to residual PAH concentrations after 21 days of biodegradation. Persulfate oxidation of samples that had first been subjected to biodegradation yielded only limited additional PAH oxidation. This implies that oxidation and biodegradation removed approximately the same PAH fraction. Persulfate oxidation thus provides a good and rapid method for the prediction of PAH bioavailability. Thermogravimetric analysis of oxidized and untreated samples showed that persulfate oxidation primarily affected expanded organic matter. The results indicate that this expanded organic matter contained mainly readily bioavailable PAHs.},

  Abstract                 = {The composition of amorphous and condensed soil/sediment organic matter (SOM) domains was investigated for one soil sample and four sediment samples. These samples were oxidized with persulfate to remove amorphous SOM, before and after which the composition of SOM was studied by thermogravimetric analysis, pyrolysis-GC/MS, and cross polarization magic angle spinning 13 C-NMR. Comparison of the SOM composition before and after oxidation showed that condensed SOM was more thermostable and less polar than amorphous SOM. Condensed SOM was relatively low in O?alkyl C and carboxyl C and it was likely to contain only small amounts of labile organic components (carbohydrates, peptides, fatty acids). Apart from these general characteristics, the composition of the condensed and amorphous domains appeared to be highly dependent on the origin and nature of the SOM investigated. Condensed domains in relatively undecomposed SOM were enriched in aliphatic C, whereas condensed domains in relatively weathered SOM were enriched in aromatic C. Altogether, the compositional changes upon persulfate oxidation were similar to the compositional changes upon humi?cation, which supports the idea that weathered SOM is more con- densed than the original material.},

Mountain erosion rates have been estimated from current relief and precipitation, but a more complete evaluation of the controls on erosion rates requires detailed measurements across a range of timescales. Here we report erosion rates in the Taiwan mountains estimated from modern river sediment loads, Holocene river incision and thermochronometry on a million-year scale. Estimated erosion rates within the actively deforming mountains are high (3?6 mm yr 21 ) on all timescales, but the pattern of erosion has changed over time in response to the migration of localized tectonic deformation. Modern, decadal-scale erosion rates corre- late with historical seismicity and storm-driven runoff variabil- ity. The highest erosion rates are found where rapid deformation, high storm frequency and weak substrates coincide, despite low topographic relief.},

This study was conducted to evaluate the utility of dithionite, stannous chloride, and hydrofluoric acid 13 HF extraction for Fe removal and solid-state C NMR spectral enhancement in forested Spodosols. Extraction with 2% HF resulted in the greatest removal of Fe 45%?99% , while 4% wrv dithionite extraction was the least effective in removing Fe from the same soils 8%?54% The 2% HF treatment also removed the largest proportion of total C 12%?67% and total N 19%?66% . In five of the 10 mineral horizon soils studied, the CrN ratios changed more than 25% after HF treatment, suggesting that some alteration of bulk chemical composition occurred. The treatment had little effect on low-Fe samples because the quality of NMR spectra was similar between untreated and chemically treated organic horizon Oa soil samples. For soils high in Fe, as is typical in Spodosol mineral horizons, the 2% HF and the 0.05 M SnCl treatment showed 2 some spectral improvement but the results were inconsistent. 13 C NMR spectra for soil HF extracts indicated that carbohydrate and carboxyl C groups were preferentially removed in the extraction. Some quantitative changes of C distribution among various structures were observed after HF treatment, possibly indicating the alteration of organic matter during extraction. Several factors may contribute to the differences in the determination of various C groups by 13 C NMR spectroscopy before and after chemical treatment, including poor signal-to-noise SrN ratios, interactions between paramagnetic ions and different C moieties, preferential removal of some C groups by different chemicals, sideband interference, mass loss, and perhaps other factors. Based on our results, it seems premature to recommend routine chemical pretreatment as a means of improving 13 C NMR spectral quality.},

Trata-se de uma unidade geotectônica composta principalmente por suítes graníticas associadas a uma variedade de xenólitos de rochas metamórficas de baixo a alto grau de metamorfismo (PHILIPP et al., 2000). Conforme IBGE (1986) são encontradas no Batólito de Pelotas duas unidades geomorfológicas: o planalto residual Canguçu-Caçapava do Sul, com altitudes em torno de 400 m (onde estão localizados os perfis analisados) e o planalto rebaixado marginal, posicionado altimetricamente entre 100 e 200 m. Em razão da grande diversidade geológica da região, os solos apresentam uma gênese complexa, evidenciada pela carência de trabalhos sobre o estudo de solos da região do Escudo Sul-Rio-Grandense. Conforme BRASIL (1973) e STRECK et. al (2008), os solos predominantes nesta região como unidades de mapeamento simples e/ou compostas são: Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo Distrófico úmbrico e típico (unidades de mapeamento - UM Camaquã e Matarazo), Luvissolo Háplico Órtico típico (UM Bexigoso) e Neossolo Regolítico Distro-úmbrico típico ou léptico típico (UM Pinheiro Machado).

Para representar a relação solo-paisagem demarcou-se transetos representativos em diferentes locais da área estudada, desde o ponto mais elevado área até o ponto mais baixo junto ao rio ou riacho representativo da área, caracterizando as superfícies: (1) ? topo; (2) ? rebordo; (3) ? coxilhas e (4) planícies aluviais. Nesta área, solos mais desenvolvidos como Nitossolos, Argissolos e Chernossolos foram achados em superfícies geomórficas mais estáveis como topo (superfície 1), terraços na superfície 2 e nas coxilhas onduladas e suaves onduladas na superfície 3. Solos menos desenvolvidos como os Neossolos Litólicos e os Cambissolos ocorrem em relevos mais acidentados (superfície 2). Planossolos e Gleissolos predominam nas planícies aluviais (superfície 4). O entendimento das relações entre solos e superfície geomórfica nesta área de estudo é requerimento básico para estabelecer a legenda para mapeamento de solos bem como para selecionar a escala do material básico cartográfico para levantamento de solos e estabelecer o planejamento racional de uso destas terras.},

We characterized the organic matter by solid-state cross-polarization magic angle spinning (CPMAS) 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The organic matter content in the Ferralsols increased from the lowest to the highest sites (440?950 m altitude) as a result of the increase in humidity and the decrease in temperature. This influence was more pronounced in the heavy clayey Ferralsols, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter was enhanced by organo-mineral interactions. Iron oxides contributed to the stabilization of the organic matter in these soils, which was dominated by O?alkyl C structures followed by aromatic and alkyl C groups. The aromatic C contribution to the total organic C increases with depth at the expense of O?alkyl C, regardless of the site altitude and climate. Although the impact of the environment on the amount of organic matter and its chemical composition is confirmed, our results clearly show that this is so only for the surface horizons. With increasing soil depth the climatic influence decreased, showing that other factors become more important for the accumulation of organic matter.},

This article will show that these systems engineering tools and techniques are in fact quite simple and can provide critical insight into how stakeholder requirements drive the engineering design process. This helps ensure that customer requirements are satisfied throughout the entire system lifecycle and aids in reducing expensive design iterations due to poorly understood or poorly documented requirements. These goals are achieved by deriving figures of merit and combining them using standard scoring functions to steer efforts towards fulfilling the customer?s objectives early in the design process. Few papers in the literature capture the basic elements of tradeoff analyses in a way that entices the engineer to utilize the techniques. We have attempted to ameliorate this problem. Most of the practices presented in the literature are written from a decision analysis perspective. The success of such techniques is dependent on the expertise of the analyst in that several of the methods require considerable analyst experience for them to be employed effectively. This paper presents standardized methodologies for carrying out tradeoff analyses, which are applicable to a wide array of problems and also demonstrates that these techniques are relatively simple to use.},

  Abstract                 = {In this Chapter, we describe the steps followed to build and improve the Soil Geographical Database of Eurasia at scale 1:1,000,000 and suggest automatic soil mapping techniques to improve it. The work started in 1952 with the compilation of materials provided by the contributing countries to publish the Soil Map of the European Communities at scale 1:1,000,000 in 1985. From then on, it was computerised, geo-referenced, structured to form a geographic database, enriched using archives of the original materials, extended geographically and thematically, harmonised over country borders, updated and documented. Despite this streamline of development and enhancements, it has limitations inherent to the initial objective of publishing a paper map and to the wide variety of views on soil mapping that were brought together from the community of contributors. The next logical step would thus be to improve the Soil Database by using existing detailed soil information and newly European-wide available satellite data and digital elevation models (DEMs). Existing soil maps at larger scale available in some parts of Europe could be used as training references to assess the morphometric (relief) and spectral characteristics of the Soil Mapping Units (SMUs) from DEM and satellite images, and the results extrapolated beyond to the surrounding areas and compared with the present delineation included in the 1:1,000,000 Soil Database. The Limousin Region of France was chosen as a test area but other geomorphologically diverse and representative areas in Europe should be included as well. This work is in progress but more partners will be needed in a collaborative project effort to establish a multi-scale European Soil Information System.},

The mainobjective of this study was to use DSM to produce soil maps of a relatively small area (about 100 km2) and compare it to a preliminary soilmap made by traditional techniques. The study area is located at north of Minas Gerais State, southwest of Brazil. In this study we used decisiontree classifier, See5, and 278 soil samples to predict soil class at order level of the Brazilian System of Soil Classification. We also diduseancillary data as Landsat ratios and variables of the topography. DSM didn’t show a good performance of soil prediction because basically three factors: (a) taxonomic similarity between Argissolos and Latossolos, (b) great spatial and attributes variability of Cambissolos thatoccurred in different landscapes types, and (c) low accuracy of soil prediction to Gleissolos, Neossolos and Cambissolos of the river plaindomainbecause its shows great environment complexity. Following works will make a better selection of environmental covariates,predict the soil classes in higher categorical level and assessment of quality of digital soil maps.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) based on easily measured soil variables offer an alternative for labor-intensive bulk density (b) measurements. The predictive quality of 12 published PTFs was evaluated using an independent dataset of forest soils (1614 samples) from Flanders, Belgium. For all samples, PTF accuracy and precision was calculated, and for topsoil and subsoil samples separately. All functions were found to produce a systematic underestimation of predicted b, with mean prediction errors (MPEs) ranging between 0.01 and 0.51 Mg m3. Most PTFs performed differently when applied to topsoil or subsoil data. Prediction of topsoil b showed the highest prediction error. The evaluation demonstrated the poor performance of some published PTFs, and raised concern that the predictive ability of even the better models may not be adequate. Therefore, two candirdate PTFs were recalibrated and validated. With recalibration, accuracy improved considerably and showed a near-zero bias, but precision increased only slightly. The best fitted empirical model was based on loss-on-ignition (LOI): b  1.775  0.173(LOI)1/2. Its predictive capacity was not significantly better than the Adams physical two-component model b  100/{(LOI/0.312)  [(100  LOI)/1.661]}. For the prediction of b in forest soils, LOI was two times more important than texture variables, and LOI alone accounted for 55% of the total variation. The lowest root mean squared prediction error (RMSPE) was 0.16 Mg m3 for LOI-based, and 0.21 Mg m3 for texture-based models. Separate calibration of topsoil and subsoil layers did not enhance the predictive capacity significantly.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to examine the interactive effects of tillage and land forms (erodibility) on the redistribution of C, N and P within an agricultural landscape. Soils were sampled from an undulating maize field in central Belgium. Half of the field was under conventional tillage (CT), while the rest was under minimum tillage (MT) management. Based on slope and curvature characteristics, depositional and erodible zones were identified in both tillage treatments. We analyzed 400 surface (0?5 cm) soil samples, and 25 soil profiles (0?100 cm). Concentrations of native C, maize-derived C, total N, Olsen P, and moisture content in the 0?5 cm soil layer showed distinct spatial patterns with variogram ranges from 30 to 90 m. These patterns were related to local differences in texture and landform. In general, nutrient concentrations were greater in lower, depositional areas, and smaller in higher, erodible areas. In addition, the impact of landform was more pronounced in CT than MT. Three years after the implementation of the tillage treatments, native C, total N and Olsen P stocks (0?46 cm) in erodible zones were about 40% less under CT than under MT. However, in depositional zones, nutrient stocks were equal between the tillage treatments. Differences in erosion rates, the distribution of Olsen P and maize-derived C indicated that this pattern was mainly caused by soil transport induced by erosion since the implementation of the tillage treatments, rather than local differences in decomposition rates. We concluded that the influence of landforms on the stabilization and redistribution processes of nutrients is greater within CT than MT. Therefore, interactions between landform and agricultural management need to be considered in regional soil organic matter inventory assessments.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil behavior is a function of intrinsic soil properties, interacting environmental processes, and cultural practices. Observation, prediction, and visualization of soil behavior at variable spatial and temporal scales are required to enhance our understanding of complex soil processes and to develop optimal environmental management strategies. Recent advances in information technology, simulation modeling, and computer graphics provide opportunities to convey our knowledge and perception of soil behavior under variable environmental conditions and soil management regimes. Soil information is commonly presented in textual, map, and graphical forms which often fail to convey the dynamic nature of soil behavior under field conditions. Historical and contemporary developments in the presentation of soil information and behavior are reviewed, and a framework for soil visualization is proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {We studied the soils of the Patio de la Acequia garden of the Generalife, a palatial villa forming part of La Alhambra, a World Heritage Site in Granada, Spain. This garden, which is estimated to be around 700 years old, is the oldest historical garden in the Western World. The soils are man-made cumulimollihumic-calcaric (hypereutric, anthric) Regosols. Noteworthy amongst the main pedogenic processes, in relation to the human activities of cultivation, irrigation and tillage, are horizonation, melanization (the contents of organic carbon varied between 0.59% and 8.87%, and those of P205 extracted with citric acid between 723 mg kg?1 and 7333 mg kg?1, with maximae in the Ap horizons) and structure formation. The soil fabric, studied at the ultramicroscopic level using scanning electron microscopy, is of laminar and partition-walls? type in the lower horizons, depending on the microped zones. The partition-walls? fabrics found are different to those of the possible pre-existing sedimentary fabrics. These are numerous lithological discontinuities and at least two burials, leading us to deduce that there have been two main stages of filling with materials in the formation of these soils. The first is Arabic-Medieval (13th century), when the garden was created, its surface being some 50 cm below the level of the paved area of the present patio. In the deeper parts, the materials employed in the fill are similar to the in situ soils of the zone, unaffected by the buildings. The second stage is Christian (15th century to the present day). During this period the Medieval garden was gradually buried under a layer of materials from the nearby soils and/or sediments mixed with manure until the surface was only just below the level of the paved area of the patio. In this work we discuss the difficult classification of these relatively little studied soils. In spite of their being clearly related to human activity, they are not classified as Anthrosols in the FAO system (1998) because soil materials cannot be classified as anthropopedogenic or as anthropogeomorphic.},

Os solos estudados foram: a) Nitossolo Vermelho, designado como TR (Typic Argiudoll); b) Latossolo Vermelho Eutroférrico, LR (Typic Eutrorthox); c) Argissolo Vermelho, PE (Typic Argiudoll); d) Latossolo Vermelho, LE (Typic Haplortox), sudividido em três categorias de acordo com a textura; e) Neossolo Quartzarênico, AQ (Ty.pic Quartzipsamment) e f) Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo, PV (Typic Paleudalf). Foram coletadas amostras superficiais e subsuperficiais, e analisadas quanto a características químicas, físicas e mineralógicas. As amostras de terra receberam quatro tratamentos químicos de dissolução seletiva: a) Testemunha; b) H2O2 para remoção de matéria orgânica; c) H2O2 + Oxalato Ácido de Amônio para remoção de matéria orgânica e de ferro amorfo; d) H2O2 e Ditionito-Citrato-Bicarbonato de Sódio para remoção de matéria orgânica, de ferro amorfo e de ferro cristalino. Esses tratamentos foram comparados utilizando suas respectivas curvas espectrais e simulação de dados do sensor TM (Thematic Mapper)/ Landsat. A remoção da matéria orgânica promoveu aumento da reflectância em todo o espectro analisado, para todos os solos. A remoção da matéria orgânica e do ferro amorfo causou aumento geral da reflectância para todos os solos, mas sem modificar o formato das curvas espectrais. A remoção do ferro cristalino provocou aumento da reflectância na região inicial do espectro (até 1.000 nm), mas não nas regiões intermediárias (entre 1.000 e 1.900 nm) e final do espectro (acima de 1.900 nm). O ferro cristalino mostrou-se responsável pelas concavidades formadas em 400 nm e em 850nm. Os dados orbitais simulados mostraram que é possível discriminar diferenças relativas à matéria orgânica e às formas de ferro. O uso de radiometria de laboratório mostrou-se uma técnica rápida, não destrutiva, e pouco exigente em preparo para analisar feições de absorção por ferro e efeitos de matéria orgânica em curvas especiais de solos.},

A spectroradiometer (Spectral reflectance between: 400-2,500 nm) was utilized in laboratory. The soils evaluated are located in Bauru region, SP, Brazil, and are classified as Typic Argiudoll (TR), Typic Eutrorthox (LR), Typic Argiudoll (PE), Typic Haplortox (LE), Typic Paleudalf (PV) and Typic Quartzipsamment (AQ). They were characterized by their spectral reflectance as for descriptive conventional methods (Brazilian and International) according to the types of spectral curves. A method for the spectral descriptive evaluation of soils was established. It was possible to characterize and discriminate the soils by their spectral reflectance, with exception for LR and TR. The spectral differences were better identified by the general shape of spectral curves, by the intensity of band absorption and angle tendencies. These characteristics were mainly influenced by organic matter, iron, granulometry and mineralogy constituents. A reduction of iron and clay contents, which influ- enced higher reflectance intensity and shape variations, occurred on the soils LR/TR, PE, LE, PV and AQ, on that sequence. Soils of the same group with different clay textures could be discriminated. The conventional descriptive evaluation of spectral curves was less efficient on discriminating soils. Simu- lated orbital data discriminated soils mainly by bands 5 and 7.},

Enhanced microaggregate formation and stabilization of C due to reduced macroaggregate turnover has been proposed as a mechanism promoting C sequestration in no-tillage (NT) compared with conventional tillage (CT) systems in temperate soils dominated by 2:1 clay mineralogy. We evaluated the contribution of macroaggregate-protected microaggregates to total soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in NT relative to CT in three soils differing in clay mineralogy: a 2:1 clay-dominated soil (2:1), a soil with mixed clay mineralogy [2:1 and 1:1] and oxides (mixed), and a soil dominated by (1:1) clay minerals and oxides (1:1). Microaggregates (mM) were isolated from macroaggregates from 0- to 5- and 5- to 20-cm soil layers. Particulate organic matter (POM) located within the microaggregates (intra-mM-POM) was separated from POM outside of the microaggregates (inter-mM-POM) and the mineral fraction of the microaggregates (mineral-mM). In all three soils, total SOC as well as microaggregate-associated C (mM-C) was greater with NT compared with CT. Although less than half of the total SOC under NT was associated with the microaggregate fraction, more than 90% of the total difference in SOC between NT and CT was explained by the difference in mM-C in all three soils. Thus, we identified and isolated a fraction that explains almost the entire difference in total SOC between NT and CT across soils characterized by drastically different clay mineralogy.},

It focuses on six topographic factors, or existences, that are important in characterizing the biophysical functions of topography: elevation, surface shape, topographic position, topographic context, spatial scale, and landform object. Terrain analysis approaches are assessed according to what they really deal with, as well as how they work. Important trends are consequently identi? ed, in which spatial scale plays critical but non-uniform roles. An index-based approach to the compound function of multiple topographic existences is recognized as successful in modelling surface/subsurface moisture and mass movement potential, but not mountain temperature. A classi? cation scheme categorises de? ned landforms in the literature according to the way they exist in human knowledge rather than their morphological properties and derivation methods. Five categories are outlined: bona ? de objects, prototypical objects, ? at objects, landform classes, and multiscale objects. Peak object delineation is lastly assessed as an example demonstrating some of the recent trends in terrain analysis. Representations of higher-scale landscape context are identi? ed to have great potential of linking vastly different spatial scales, as well as bridging ?eld- versus object-based treatments of the terrain surface.},

  Abstract                 = {This article questions the arbitrary selection of input attributes for the definition of landform classes and other fiat objects that are used to represent the biophysical environment in geographic information science. It suggests that attribute selection influences the characterization of both geographic and attribute space in these applications. Hence digital elevation model-based fuzzy c-means landform classification relies on sensible selection of terrain attributes to generate fuzzy landform classes (memberships) with biophysical meanings. A case study employed several sets of sensitivity tests and evaluated how selections of terrain attributes may affect the outputs of fuzzy c-means landform classifications. The results showed an average classification difference of 37 percent when different numbers of attributes are used and 18 percent when similar terrain attributes are swapped. Effects of attribute selection also show obvious dependence on spatial resolution and number of classes. These results indicate that the current approach of selecting terrain attributes (not only for landform classifications but also for other applications) according to tacit expert knowledge needs to be better justified. Because the fuzzy c-means classification method is essentially data-driven, the adoption of an exploratory approach as a part of this method is crucial. Such an approach may help to identify membership distributions (and corresponding classifications) that summarize the correspondence between landforms and specific biophysical patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {As most mountains in tropical and subtropical zones, the Western Sierra Madre suffers active present erosion, which may create some constraints to the social and economic development in the area. The objectives of this study of soil degradation in the Western Sierra Madre, are to determine the respective roles of gully and sheet erosion. This research is based on field observations, field measurements of runoff and, soil losses at the plot, as well as the watershed scales as an analysis of an exhaustive census of the few gullies located in an experimental area. Measured soil losses in the Western Sierra Madre are high although there are few gullies. Most of the sediment yield seems to originate in widespread degraded areas where stoniness is the main evidence of a previous stage of erosion. Previously overgrazing and deforestation were determined as the factors of the appearance of new soil surface characteristics which explain the high runoff and sediment productions. The soil compacted by cattle trampling reduces infiltration. The decrease of the vegetation cover triggers a rise in the splash effect and thus, a soil sealing. These processes induce an increase in runoff and soil losses. The main erosion type has been described as sheet erosion: it is characterised by the removal of fine soil particles and the remains of gravels, pebbles and blocks, which constitute a pavement on the soil. Gullies generally appear on the bottom of wide valleys and depressions, where soils are thick. It is shown that sheet erosion is two orders of magnitude higher than gully erosion at the hillslope scale. Due to the spatial distribution of land use and the geological context such as the heavily degraded areas close to the main rivers, the reduction of runoff and soil loss rates within the extension of a considered area, commonly observed in hydrology, only applies up to the elementary catchments scale (1 to 50 km 2 ). Above this area, runoff coefficient and soil loss rates increase.},

Depending on the size of rock fragments gravel, pebbles, stones andror . blocks and especially the way they are integrated into the soil matrix, they may facilitate or hinder infiltration and promote soil losses. The present study examines the role of different soil surface features and their influence on runoff formation and on soil erosion in an area seriously affected by overgrazing. Based on measurements made on hillslopes for 2 years at the plot scale, the results show that grass cover, pebbles and sand content increase runoff and erosion. Inversely, slope value, tree cover percentage, structural stability and organic matter content are negatively correlated with runoff and soil losses. It is shown that the correlations can be explained by the major role played by the surface features on hydrologic behaviour of the hillslopes. Two main surface features were identified and  . hydraulically characterised, namely: i crusted surfaces with embedded gravel widespread on  . gentle slopes which induce high runoff and erosion rates; and ii stony surfaces, where free pebbles and blocks protect the top soil against raindrops and overland flow kinetic energy and lead to reduce runoff and soil losses.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil structure is defined as ?the spatial heterogeneity of the different components or properties of soil?. Aspects of soil structure which are important for plant development, soil water balance and soil workability are reviewed briefly. The different types of soil structure which occur on different size scales are placed in a hierarchical order. Different mechanisms give rise to the different hierarchical orders. Similarly, different physical/chemical/biological processes are involved in the stabilization of the different hierarchical orders. A number of methods for measuring soil structure are described. Preference is given to methods involving direct observation of structural features by scanning electron microscopy and by optical scanning of impregnated sections and fracture surfaces. These need to be supported by assessments of the stabilities of compound particles in water and of the mechanical strengths of compound particles as a function of water content. ?Good? soil structure is described as one where all the hierarchical orders are well-developed and stable. The greatest lack of knowledge appears to be in the 2?100 ?m size range which is too large to have been studied by colloid chemists and too small to be visible to the naked eye. It is suggested that more observations of soil structure should be made in this size range, as it may hold many important clues on how to manage soil structure in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {No presente trabalho, foi estudada a extração de substâncias húmicas (SH) de horizontes A de dois solos do Rio Grande do Sul (Latossolo Roxo (LR), e Brunizém vértico (B)) e de um lodo orgânico (LO), oriundo da fabricação de celulose, empregando-se dois métodos: (1) as SH foram extraídas com solução de NaOH 0,5 mol L -1 , após tratamento prévio com HCl 0,5 mol L -1 ; (2) foi introduzida a extração com solução de pirofosfato de sódio 0,15 mol L -1 (pH 7) antes da etapa alcalina. Em cada etapa, os teores de SH, de ácidos fúlvicos (AF) e de ácidos húmicos (AH) foram determinados por métodos espectroscópicos e gravimétricos e, no método 2, os teores de Fe, Al, Si e Ca foram medidos nos extratos por absorção atômica. A composição elementar de ácidos húmicos foi determinada, e sua estrutura e características químicas foram avaliadas a partir de razões C/N, (atômicas) H/C e O/C e a partir de dados de espectroscopia Ultravioleta/Visível (UV/Vis). No LR, o método 1 extraiu maior quantidade de SH, enquanto, no método 2, a etapa com pirofosfato extraiu apenas AF. Em contrapartida, no solo B, o método 2 foi mais eficiente, verificando-se maior rendimento na etapa com pirofosfato. A partir desses resultados, infere-se que as SH, no LR, interagem principalmente por meio de reação de trocas de ligantes e de pontes de hidrogênio e, no solo B, a interação por meio de pontes de cátions é um mecanismo importante. Os AH extraídos com NaOH apresentaram valores mais elevados para a razão H/C e valores inferiores para a razão O/C do que os extraídos com pirofosfato, indicando que o extrator neutro solubilizou SH de caráter aromático e grau de oxigenação superiores.},

  Abstract                 = {Organic matter plays a major role in the chemical and physical attributes of highly weathered soils usually found in tropical and subtropical regions. In the present work, soil organic matter (SOM) of six representative Brazilian Ferralsol profiles was examined by chemical analyses, solid state 13 C and 15 N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy. The HF treatment, realized with the soil samples prior to the spectroscopic analysis, promoted both C and N enrichment, and no selective dissolution of specific C-compounds was identified. The recovery of C and N ranged between 47% and 66% in the A horizon and decreased pronouncedly with depth. The solubility of SOM after HF treatment, especially in deeper horizons, was related to its occurrence in organo-mineral associates. The results obtained by 13 C NMR revealed that the SOM of A horizons of the Brazilian Ferralsols is characterized by a considerable amount of O-alkyl (29?38%), followed by lower proportions of alkyl (24?30%) and aromatic structures (10?14%). The organic nitrogen occurred mainly as amide, as indicated by the 15 N NMR analysis. A similar pattern was exhibited by the SOM of lower horizons. The C/N ratio varied between 8 and 21 and tended to decrease with depth. The same trend was found for the semiquinone-type free radicals concentrations, determined by ESR spectroscopy. The occurrence of a SOM showing a medium decomposition degree containing structures of low chemical recalcitrance points to a stabilization of organic matter mainly through surface interactions with iron oxides and kaolinite.},

  Abstract                 = {In southern Brazil, the landscape restoration after the exhaustion of open cast coal mines involves the ?lling of mine cavities with both pedogenic and geological material. The objective of this work was to determine the content and chemical composition of the organic matter of two constructed soils (24 years and 2 years) in a coal mining area in southern Brazil. An undisturbed Acrisol and geological material from three sites were also sampled. Samples were analyzed for carbon and nitrogen contents by dry combustion and for chemical composition of the organic matter by 13 C NMR CPMAS and FTIR spectroscopies. Prior to the spectroscopic analyses, the samples were treated with 10% (m/m) hydro?uoric acid solution, which lead to a carbon enrichment in the sample of 2?46 times. The three coal samples were mainly composed of aromatic C (46?63%) and alkyl C (10?28%), and di?ered largely in the carbon content (18?312 g kg 1 ). The C/N ratio of 27 and the proportions of O-alkyl C (26%) and aromatic C (29%) found in the native soil (18 g C kg 1 soil) suggest a coal contam- ination of the native site. The proportions of O/N-alkyl C (15?17%), alkyl C (22?23%) and aromatic C (39?41%) observed in the organic matter of the A1 horizon of the two constructed soils were intermediate to those of the coal samples and the native soil. In the younger constructed soil the proportion of O/N-alkyl diminished and that of aromatic C increased with depth, whereas in the older constructed soil this trend was less evident. Our results show that, during the 24 years after site reconstruction, the input of vegetation residues diluted the proportion of recalcitrant organic matter. The aromaticity index calculated from the FTIR data (I 1620 /I 2920 ) correlated positively with the aryl C/alkyl C ratio, obtained from the NMR data, evidencing the applicability of the FTIR index for geological and coal contaminated samples.},

Samples from three environments were studied: native pasture under grazing, without burning and shortening (NP); native pasture under grazing and burning (BP); and native forest (NF) adjacent to the pasture area. Soil samples were collected in four layers: 0?5, 0?20, 20?40 and 40?60 cm, in which fertility attributes and contents of C and N were determined, and analyses of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) were performed. Samples from the above ground vegetation from these environments were analyzed through elemental analyses and FTIR. Pasture burning reduced soil contents of N, Mg and K, and increased Al saturation in soil, in comparison to NP soil. Nutrient contents were smaller in the soil samples under forest, when compared to NP, while C and N contents and Al saturation were greater. The aromatic character of soil organic matter did not differ among the studied environments, and increased with depth in all environments. In comparison to NP, BP vegetation had a lower N content and a greater proportion of Si groups. The forest vegetation contained more N and showed higher aromaticity than the pasture vegetation.},

Soil samples were collected from the 0?5, 5?10 and 10?20 cm layers of conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) plots, and of the adjoining soil under native vegetation (NV) of Cerrado (tropical) or grassland (subtropical). Conversion of NV to CT resulted in losses of 7?29% of the original C stock of 0?20 cm; conversion to NT increased this C stock by 0?12% compared with CT.Organic matter composition of the 0?5 cmlayer, assessed by solid state CPMAS-13C-NMR, ESR and laser induced fluorescence spectroscopies, was affected by land use and tillage systems. Conversion of NV to CT decreased O-alkyl and increased aromatic, carbonyl, aromatic/O-alkyl ratio, free radicals concentration and fluorescence signal. The opposite trend was observed when NT replaced CT. The relative losses and gains of C and qualitative changes resulting from land use and tillage were less evident in fine- than in coarse-textured soils, suggesting a greater resistance and a smaller resilience of fine- compared with coarse-textured soils. The direct relation between increase in C stock and increase in potentially labile moieties (e.g. O-alkyl) and the decrease in more recalcitrant moieties (e.g. aromatics) in NT soils suggests that spatial inaccessibility by aggregates is playing a major role, compared with selective preservation, in promoting C accumulation in NT soils.},

The gently undulated test site Melsungen in Northern Hessia features 130 singleobservation points representing a range of different morphological situations. Assuming the terrain reveals a seasonal varying influence on nocturnal air temperature patterns near ground, a comparative study was carried out between the meteorological transitional period showing active vegetation cover and the colder season without any active vegetation cover. Using stepwise multiple linear regression analysis, different terrain parameters have been tested. The results reveal changing influences of terrain attributes on nocturnal air temperaturepattern depending on seasonal variations of vegetation cover. During the transitional period, a maximum variance of 55 % is explained by a combination of different terrain parameters and in the colder season even up to 68 %.},

Realizou-se o diagnóstico físico conservacionista em 1966 e 2001, onde se determinou o uso potencial, conflitos de uso da terra, áreas a florestar, disponibilidade ou excesso para agricultura, áreas a serem traba- lhadas. Realizou-se uma batimetria no reservatório do Vacacaí Mirim em 2001, onde foi comparada com levantamento de 1961 e batimetria de 1997. Foi constatado um assoreamento de 29,45% em 29 anos de operação do reservatório do Vacacaí. Conclui-se que a urbanização desordenada, em áreas declivosas e de preservação permanente, a agricultura e pecuária em áreas inadequadas e sem tratos conservacionistas, a retirada da vegetação nativa (desmatamento de cabecei- ras, divisores d?água, retirada de mata ciliar) têm contribuído para a deterioração da bacia hidrográfica do Vacacaí Mi-rim.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is of primary importance for maintaining soil productivity, and agricultural management practices may significantly influence SOM chemical properties. However, how SOM chemical characteristics change with agricultural practices is poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the impacts of tillage (conventional vs. conservation) management on the structural and compositional characteristics of SOM using cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning (CPMAS) and total sideband suppression (TOSS) solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared (DRIFT) spectroscopy. We characterized both physically and chemically isolated SOM fractions from a Norfolk soil (fine-loamy, siliceous, thermic Typic Kandiudults) under long-term tillage management (20 yr). The solid-state 13C NMR results indicated that humic acid (HA) from conventional tillage (CT, 0-5 cm) was less aliphatic and more aromatic than HA from conservation tillage (CnT). The aliphatic C content decreased with increasing depth (0-15 cm) for both CT and CnT treatments. The reverse trend was true for aromatic C content. Based on reactive/recalcitrant (O/R) peak ratio comparisons, HA was more reactive in the top soil (0-5 cm) under CnT than CT. Both soil organic C (SOC) and light fraction (LF) material were higher in the 0- to 5-cm soil of CnT than CT treatment. Our results show that long-term tillage management can significantly change the characteristics of both physical and chemical fractions of SOM.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe an approach for digital mapping of soil properties based on dual use of secondary information. In the first stage, multivariate secondary information is used to stratify a landscape for sampling. A new clustering algorithm was developed for this, which allows conducting spatially constrained cluster analysis using mixed categorical and continuous secondary attributes. The stratification is used to optimise sampling by constrained spatial simulated annealing (CSSA). Sampled values and correlated secondary attributes are then used in simple kriging with varying local means (SKLMs) to perform final mapping. We applied this method to mapping of soil carbon stock (CS) in the top 0.3 m of soil. Using secondary information greatly reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of CS prediction as compared with ordinary kriging (OK) of sampled CS alone. When sampling intensity was decreased, RMSE increased more with OK than by using SKLM for local prediction. Among the ancillary variables, on-the-go sensed soil electrical conductivity was most useful for CS mapping. Further research should focus on developing a generic framework for thematic soil mapping at different scales. More standardised procedures are required for processing of secondary information, optimising sampling designs and performing local prediction to minimise cost and achieve high precision.},

  Abstract                 = {Many countries completed large scale (1:5,000 – 1:25,000) soil surveys decades ago, and have since used their thematic and geographic information to derive thematic soil property layers of the same or smaller scale (1:100,000 and smaller). The new layers are often simply aggregates of the original soil polygons and inherit the same geographic relationships that were delineated in the original data source. In reality, this approach does not use all information of the input data. Instead of aggregating existing maps, the original, non-interpreted ﬁeld survey point data can be gathered and used for deriving new property layers. The paper aims to summarize a soil database development project using legacy data for a transboundary area, representing two different systems of data collection, storage and management. Recent and archived soil proﬁle data have been collected, including monitoring sites, soil nutrient status campaign data for different periods, and recorded soil proﬁles from previous soil mapping activities. These data sources have een transformed to have a common theoretical basis using commonly accepted pedotransfer rules and an integrated proﬁle database has been formed. It was used to interpolate soil information and develop soil property maps and layers repre- senting the WRB diagnostic properties and horizons. The creation of the property layers was based on statistical/geostatistical interpolations of the soil proﬁle database using DEM derivatives, SPOT and Landsat satellite images as covariates to provide information for the natural setting of the area. The interpolated values for the numeric variables were estimated using regression kriging, while the classiﬁed variables were calculated using the maximum likelihood classiﬁcation algorithm. It was concluded, that the development of WRB diagnostic criteria database is feasible using raw data of different origin and a set of harmonization and digital soil mapping tools.},

  Abstract                 = {A pilot study on the derivation of soil organic content information was carried out using MODIS data, digital elevation data (SRTM-30, 1-km resolution), derived digital terrain variables and the profile database of the Hungarian Soil Monitoring system. A regression-kriging procedure was used to spatially predict the organic matter content for the whole of Hungary. The goal of the study was to characterise the performance of regression analysis using satellite and terrain data as a potential method for soil variable mapping and to derive a soil-organic matter content map for Hungary. Eight-day composites of Terra MODIS were used (1-8 May, 2000 and 1-8 Sept, 2000, with 500-m resolution, channels 1-7 and 21). The satellite image layers were spectrally improved. Numerous terrain variables were derived from the SRTM-30 and were used as input variables to the regression. Logarithmic and square root transformations were done for some of the layers and variables to achieve normality. Via these preprocessing and transformation algorithms a new integrated satellite and terrain database was created. This database was used for estimating the soil organic matter content by regression analysis and kriging. The statistical correlations and the percentages of variation explained by the regression models were always significant. However, their values were relatively low.},

The original purpose of the book was to present a unified theoretical and conceptual framework for statistical modelling in a way that was accessible to undergraduate students and researchers in other fields. This new edition has been expanded to include nominal (or multinomial) and ordinal logistic regression, survival analysis and analysis of longitudinal and clustered data. Although these topics do not fall strictly within the definition of generalized linear models, the underlying principles and methods are very similar and their inclusion is consistent with the original purpose of the book. The new edition relies on numerical methods more than the previous edition did. Some of the calculations can be performed with a spreadsheet while others require statistical software. There is an emphasis on graphical methods for exploratory data analysis, visualizing numerical optimization (for example, of the likelihood function) and plotting residuals to check the adequacy of models. The data sets and outline solutions of the exercises are available on the publisher?s website: www.crcpress.com/us/ElectronicProducts/downandup.asp?mscssid=I am grateful to colleagues and students at the Universities of Queensland and Newcastle, Australia, for their helpful suggestions and comments about the material.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil sampling and measurement often consume a significant portion of the budget available for a project. On a national or worldwide basis these activities require large investments, which are justified if the soil information leads to better decisions on land use or environmental issues to an extend which more than counterbalances the costs. This depends on both the costs and the quality of the information. At present soil sampling schemes are designed ad hoc or according to a protocol. In either case the available prior information on soil variability and statistical knowledge on spatial sampling is often not fully exploited. This may lead to unnecessarily high costs or low quality of the information. Therefore, sampling schemes should be designed such that either the costs are minimized under quality requirements related to the aim of the survey, or the quality is maximized for a given budget. Important aspects of quality are accuracy and precision, which can be quantified as sampling and measurement error. In this paper we describe a knowledge-based system that assists in the design of soil survey schemes. The system facilitates the full use of prior information as well as pedological, operational and statistical knowledge. Part of the knowledge will be formalized as decision rules that guide the user to suitable types of sampling designs. In addition, models and algorithms are proposed to predict the accuracy and the costs of the information, taking into account differences in spatial variability or sampling costs between sub-regions. Finally, given a stratification of the area, dynamic programming is used to determine the optimal allocation to the strata of sample points, clusters of sample points (e.g. on transects), or primary units for further (secondary) sampling. Our methodology enables prior evaluation and objective comparison of the efficiency of sampling schemes, taking into account the available resources such as budget, equipment, laboratory capacity or time available for fieldwork. The prediction and optimization part of the system is illustrated with an example of stratified sampling to estimate the areal fraction saturated with phosphate. With the given budget, the geometry of the area and four equally sized strata, the variograms and the cost functions, Simple Random Sampling for the strata turned out the be more efficient than Two-Stage Sampling from the same strata.},

For any survey a scheme should be designed specifying how and where data are to be recorded in the field, and how they are to be analysed statistically. Three formal levels are distinguished as the basis for a knowledge-based system for designing soil survey schemes. The first level depicts the role of the design in a survey project, the second distinguishes different steps in the design, and the third defines a framework of the basic concepts. Choosing a sampling design and comparing the accuracy of possible designs are essential in our support system. The accuracy of results from a scheme is defined as the mean squared error due to sampling. A computational method to predict the sampling error from prior information in the form of variograms is given and is illustrated with a case study.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are a function of the SOC concentration and the bulk density of the fine soil. Both variables are prone to changes and are influenced by abiotic and biotic processes. To determine the effect of variations of both variables on SOC stocks at two grassland sites, one with Stagnic Vertisols and one with Orthoeutric Arenosols, 440 soil cores were sampled down to 60cm depth. Bulk density and C and N concentrations were measured in 5cm intervals (0?10cm depth) and 10cm intervals (10?60cm depth). SOC stocks at the clay rich site with Vertisols were almost twice as high (86t C ha?1 in 0?60cm depth) as at the sandy site with Arenosols (48t C ha?1). Variations in the SOC stocks were determined by the thickness of the loess layer at the clay rich site. Underlying clay horizons hampered the C translocation into the subsoil which resulted in lower SOC stocks of the whole profile. Semivariograms showed spatial autocorrelations of SOC concentrations within a range of 47 and 131m, respectively. The range of autocorrelation between samples of bulk density was much shorter (39 and 51m). Relative variances in bulk density were 1?2 magnitudes lower than the variability of SOC concentration and decreased rapidly as soil depth increased. The difference in the variation of SOC concentration and bulk density was used to revise the sampling design for SOC stocks. An unequal number of samples, i.e. more SOC concentration samples than bulk density samples, would not necessarily decrease the power of the sampling design to detect SOC stock changes. In contrast, the optimum sampling design for these sites would consist of 33?44% bulk density samples and 56?67% SOC concentration samples.},

Os tratamentos corresponderam a um arranjo fatorial 7 (22 + 1). Os fatores em estudo foram amostras de sete Latossolos dispersos com NaOH 0,01 mol/L, com presença ou ausência de pré-tratamentos para remoção da matéria orgânica e dos óxidos de ferro e alumínio mal cristalizados, acrescentando-se um tratamento adicional em que foi utilizada solução de NaClO 0,01 mol/L como dispersante. Nas frações texturais separadas, realizaram-se observações com microscópio para fração silte e com lupa binocular para fração areia fina, procedendo-se, também, à caracterização mineralógica por difração de raios X (argila, silte, areia fina e areia grossa). A fração silte foi novamente dispersa, determinando-se a proporção de argila e silte após a segunda dispersão. A remoção de matéria orgânica e a de óxidos de ferro e alumínio mal cristalizados provocaram um incremento na proporção de argila, indicando a dispersão de microagregados com tamanhos correspondentes aos de outras frações texturais, em particular da fração silte. A utilização de NaClO como reagente único para remoção da matéria orgânica e dispersão da amostra não se mostrou eficaz. A presença do pseudo-silte foi confirmada em todos os solos estudados, evidenciando-se em maior proporção nos solos mais oxídicos. As frações areia fina e areia grossa também apresentaram microagregados da fração argila. A presença do pseudo-silte foi definitivamente confirmada com a segunda dispersão da fração silte, nos sete Latossolos estudados. Após a segunda dispersão, essa fração apresentou valores que variaram de 0,199 a 0,537 kg/kg de argila, complementados por 0,801 e 0,463 kg/kg de silte, respectivamente, nos sete Latossolos estudados. A liberação de maiores quantidades de argila da fração silte na segunda dispersão não indicou, necessariamente, maior presença de pseudo-silte, mas uma menor estabilidade dos microagregados. Pode-se concluir que na análise textural dos Latossolos estudados as frações silte, areia fina e areia grossa foram superestimadas, sobretudo a fração silte. A proporção de pseudo-silte nos Latossolos oxídicos estudados ultrapassa 50% na fração silte, encontrando-se o silte verdadeiro (partícula simples) constituído essencialmente por quartzo. Para reduzir a proporção de pseudo-silte, haveria a necessidade da realização de prétratamentos, fundamentalmente aquele que tende à remoção dos óxidos de ferro e alumínio mal cristalizados.},

Alguns Latossolos podem apresentar problemas de dispersão, graças à presença de microagregados de alta estabilidade.

  Abstract                 = {Soils are natural bodies that have been formed by the interaction, over time, between climate, relief, parent material and living organisms. The latter soil-forming factor encompasses vegetation, fauna and human influence. Although soil management practices and other human interventions have been acknowledged as having an impact on soil formation, early soil classifications have not ystematically catered for soils, which have been modified by man. The human influence on soil formation is much more pronounced and extensive than originally perceived. Human interventions were either direct ? through plowing, liming, manuring, fertilizing-or indirect through changing the natural soil forming factors-changing the vegetation by deforestation, changing the relief by leveling and terracing, changing the soil moisture regime through irrigation or drainage, changing the parent material through dumping or erosion. How are soil ?improvement? or ?degradation? reflected in soil classification? How and at which level does one distinguish ?natural soils? from ?anthropogenic soils?? The diversity of ?anthropogenic soils? has given rise to a proliferation of different names and units. In order to avoid a splintering of classes, it is attempted to identify the different types of man-made soils: a. Human induced changes of soil class b. Human-made diagnostic horizons c. Human induced new parent materials d. Human induced deep soil disturbance e. Human induced topsoil changes. On this basis a more systematic characterization and subdivision of ?anthropogenic soils? could be envisaged.},

  Abstract                 = {The usefulness of certain geostatistical techniques in the design of an agricultural field trial was examined. Of immediate concern was the use of these techniques to help identify an optimal sampling scheme for characterization of soil spatial variability. This was achieved by determining, a priori, the prediction error associated with various sampling designs. Our ultimate goal is to use geostatistical techniques to help minimize the confounding ird]uence of location effects on treatment differences. Knowledge of soil spatial vm'iability will be used to help locate experimental blocks on areas that are as uniform as possible, thus increasing the precision with which treatment differences can be detected. Kxiging will be used to produce interpolated contour maps of various soil properties at the experimental field site. In June 1993, a soil survey was conducted at the proposed field site. Data on various soil characteristics were collected on a 50 m x 75 m grid. Geostatistical analyses were performed on these data using public domain geostatistical software packages (GEO-EAS and GEOPACK) developed at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Semivariograms were produced for each soil ch,'u-acteristic and were modeled using a non-linear least-squares fitting procedure (Marquardt, 1963). Soil semi-variogram model parameters were input to the Optimal Sampling Scheme For Isarithmin Mapping (OSSFIM) program which was used to determine the prediction error associated with various grid sample spacings (McBratney and Webster, 1981). Output from OSSFIM allowed us to select a soil sampling scheme-i.e., of known accuracy and cost-tbr a more intensive characterization of the field site.},

The phenomenon has its structure ("characteristic, features, patterns") and underlying processes that have made it come to existence and continue to exist. The concepts are not clear throughout the paper! The so-called "phenomenon scale" is defined as being composed by a structure component (tile size and phase spacing) and a process component. The process scale is defined as the range of action and extent of effect of a phenomenon. The authors give examples. I guess that the definition of a "process scale" can be used only if the time interval in which the process is evaluated is set to a very short period. The "process scale" is defined after the spatial and temporal extents have been defined. The author do not mention this problem. Sampling density! Models are scale-dependent: "no structure can be detected which is smaller than the size of the sampling unit or larger than the extent of a study"}

  Abstract                 = {Replied runoff-erosion microplots (less than 1 m2) have been set up in eleven environments representative of the land uses in the catchment, in order to measure and evaluate their rates after each rainfall event, during dry and wet soil conditions (summer and winter, respectively). Recorded rainfall amounts and intensities were higher in summer (47 l/m2 and 0.82 mm/h, respectively) than in winter (38.25 l/m2 and 0.45 mm/h, respectively). Thus, runoff and sediment yield rates were greater in summer than in winter in all the environments. The highest runoff and erosion values, ranging from 0.84 to 13.49 l/m2 and from 11.26 to 648.43 g/m2, respectively, were measured under the cultivated olive trees environment during dry soil conditions. According to the literature data, these values may be considered very low. Cork tree environments presented the lowest values of runoff and sediment yield over the study period, presumably accounting for the importance of the vegetation cover in terms of soil protection as well as its role in improving the soil physical and chemical properties. Slightly higher significant correlation (p<0.05) between runoff and soil loss was found in winter (+0.38) than in summer (+0.30), analysing all the rainfall events and environments. Negative relationship (p<0.05) between vegetation cover and soil loss (?0.40) and runoff (?0.31), was only found in winter. Strong correlation between runoff and precipitation was revealed in both study seasons (+0.57 summer and +0.34 winter). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicates significant differences in sediment yield between the selected environments as well as the land use-land cover in winter. The high variation in the total runoff and sediment loss measured in the different environments reflects the great importance of total rainfall as well as land use on these variables. It was found that land use/cover, farmland set-aside and land misuse, can greatly affect runoff and soil erosion.},

  Abstract                 = {Haematite and goethite are the predominant pedogenic mineral phases in terra rossa from Istria. Limited variation of selected Fe oxide characteristics in analysed samples indicates the specific pedogenic environment in which terra rossa is formed. The mean value of the Fe d /Fe t ratio, taken as an index of weathering is 0.7 and reflects quite a high degree of weathering of Fe-containing primary silicates. Rela-tively uniform Fe d / clay ratios clearly indicate a predominance of co- illuviation of clay and Fe oxides. Low values of Fe o point to the low content of poorly crystalline Fe oxides in analysed terra rossa. F e o /F e d ratios in the analysed profiles vary. In the upper part of the Pomer, PoreË and Novigrad profiles Fe o /F e d ratios are higher than in the lower part of those profiles which may be explained as a result of different pedogenic environments and/or additions of external mate- rials in the upper part of those profiles. The lack of positive correla- tion between Mn d and clay and Mn d and Fe d is a consequence of remobilization of manganese due to hydromorphic processes which post-dated co-illuviation of clay and Fe oxides. During the Late Tertiary and Quaternary the pedogenic environ- ment on hard carbonate rocks of the Jurassic-Cretaceous-Palaeogene carbonate plain of southern and western Istria generally remained suitable for rubification. However, (Neo)tectonic activity and the input of external material, as well as various climatic fluctuations might have significantly effected terra rossa through the processes of erosion, colluviation, yellowing and secondary hydromorphy.},

However, soil databases often appear heterogeneous, lack common geographical references or are poorly documented (metadata). Analysis based on such data sets may generate inconsistent results that will not benefit the users. The opportunity to review and adapt soil-mapping practices came with the initiative taken by the European Commission to position the establishment and operation of an infrastructure for spatial information in Europe under a legal framework, the INSPIRE Directive. The proposed Directive includes minimum requirements for harmonising, documenting and disseminating spatial data. Member States will be asked to establish and operate infrastructures for different spatial themes in accordance with a set of technical guidelines still to be defined and approved. Over the last 10 years, the European Soil Bureau Network has gained much experience in establishing harmonised soil data for Europe and can, therefore, provide an ideal area of experimentation for the practical implementation of the recommended technical guidelines. This chapter reviews some of the changes to be made to the 1:1,000,000 scale European Soil Database to fulfil the INSPIRE requirements.},

  Abstract                 = {The conversion to pasture of indigenous forest on New Zealand hill country has led to increased mass-movement erosion and consequently increased sedimentation of waterways. Effective soil conservation requires a model that can evaluate erosion and sedimentation for different land-use scenarios. In this paper, we develop a model of mean sediment discharge related to mean erosion rates through a sediment delivery ratio. Mean erosion rate in a particular terrain (??erosion terrain??) is the product of (i) the square of mean annual rainfall with (ii) a cover factor and (iii) an erosion coefficient that depends on erosion terrain. Measurements of mean sediment discharge are used to estimate erosion coefficients for each erosion terrain. The model can be used to predict mean sediment discharge in response to land-cover/land-use scenarios. It is easy to execute and uses input data readily available in GIS layers in New Zealand. This makes it suitable for widespread management application, in contrast to physically based models which are presently only suitable for research catchments. We demonstrate the utility of the model for three different applications: evaluating land-use scenarios in the Motueka catchment; setting priorities for soil conservation in the Manawatu catchment; and determining national trends in agricultural erosion over a 30-year period. The general methodology is applicable to countries dominated by mountains and steep hills with high erosion rates.},

By using the stepwise regression method, one who attempts to select the best set of predictors of a given dependent variable will face more problems than he or she attempted to resolve. This is illustrated with an example taken from the personnel data set of a medium-sized firm. An attempt was made to explain the variation in the present salary of the workforce in terms of a number of personnel variables. Stepwise regression techniques were applied for various sample sizes. The data are used to demonstrate that stepwise regression is quite vulnerable to specification, sampling, and measurement errors. It cannot be assumed that stepwise regression will provide the best-fit model, the order of significance of predictor variables, or the relative importance of predictor variables. Stepwise regression will not necessarily derive the appropriate solution for the researcher. (Contains two tables and nine references.) (SLD)},

  Abstract                 = {A comparison was made between two soil climosequences on north- and south-facing slopes in northern Italy to determine the influence of slope aspect on soil processes. The climosequences span an elevational gradient ranging from moderate (1200 m a.s.l.) to high alpine (2420 m a.s.l.) climate zones on surfaces having an age of about 15 000 years. The soils were investigated with respect to organic C, oxalate and dithionite extractable Fe, Al and Si, elemental losses (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Fe, Al, Si, Mn) and clay minerals. The stocks of soil org. C as well as of oxalate-extractable Fe and Al was greatest in the subalpine zone near the timberline. There are no clear differences in organic C content between the soils on north- and south-facing sites. Fe-oxalate and to a lesser extent Alo-stocks were, however, greater on north-facing sites, indicating that weathering is greater there. Eluviation and illuviation of Al and Fe within the soil profile, typical for podzolisation, was more distinctly expressed on the N slopes. The probability of ITM (Imogolite-type-material) formation in the soil seemed to be greater on south-facing sites. On the north-facing sites, element leaching was most intense in the subalpine zone close to the timberline while on the south-facing sites this was only the case for the base cations. The N slopes exhibited higher leaching of elements which generally indicates a higher weathering intensity. On south-facing sites, typical podzolisation processes were measurable only above 2000 m a.s.l. The development of smectites is also a reflection of the weathering intensity; smectite was discernible in the surface horizon at all sites on N slopes but the highest amount was detected in the sub-alpine climate zone. For the south-facing sites only in the alpine climate zone could smectite be detected. Higher temperatures and an increased number of freeze-thaw cycles on south-facing slopes should theoretically enhance rates of chemical weathering. This could, however, not be confirmed with our measurements. The degree of chemical weathering increases from the south- to the north-facing sites that are characterised by lower temperatures, lower evapotranspiration and consequently by a higher humidity. Although precipitation in Alpine regions is abundant, the availability and flux of water through the soil is the prime factor in weathering intensity.},

Modeling uncertainty in elevation data results in the generation of dozens or hundreds of realizations of the elevation surface. Producing animations of these surfaces is an approach to exploratory data visualization that may assist the researcher in understanding the effect of uncertainty on spatial applications as well as in communicating the results of the research to a wider audience. A nonlinear method for interpolation between the surface realizations is introduced which allows for smooth animation while maintaining the surface characteristics prescribed by the uncertainty model.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous results from differently fertilized long-term ?eld experiments on a sandy soil suggested that the chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is affected by fertilization. The objective of this paper is to con?rm this ?nding for a site with higher soil-clay contents. Four combinations of different fertilizer treatments at long-term ?eld experiment located at a sandy loam were selected: liquid manure (LM), liquid manure+N (LM+N), straw+N (S+N) and mineral nitrogen only (N). Soil organic matter was extracted using sodium pyrophosphate solution at pH of 10 and hot water. The extracts were analyzed using Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy. The results indicate that the composition of SOM from the hot water extracts did not show signi?cant differences while the sodium pyrophosphate extracted SOM is affected by the type of fertilization. Soil samples fertilized with LM+N and S+N show the highest intensity of the carboxyl band. This can be explained by the fact that the combination of S+N fertilization with green manure leads to an enrichment of carboxyl groups in SOM. Differences between the band intensities of the treatments for the SOM samples are, however, not as distinct as for the sandy soil samples. This is possibly a result of the higher clay content and lower age of the long-term experiment at the sandy loam site. The intensity of the carboxyl band of the SOM is correlated with the cation exchange capacity of the soil samples. The composition of SOM may, in addition to the SOM content, be used for studying quantitative effects of different management practices or even land use changes on soil properties.},

The authors investigated the ways in which the local farmers categorized and managed soils and land uses. The US soil scientist also conducted independent measurements and analyses for varying indicators of soil quality throughout the catchment. There were both differences and similarities between the two views of soil quality. Farmers? understanding of soil quality was heavily influenced by the fact that agricultural production was their primary concern, while the soil scientist had a more holistic view of plant productivity. Broader scale movement of soil and water was not a particular concern of the farmers, despite the occurrence of mass wasting and slumping every year. Landform type was a key management variable for both, however, as were soil texture and drainage patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {A busca de métodos que possibilitam a determinação do teor de matéria orgânica (MO) do solo e que não geram resíduos danosos ao ambiente é importante. A oxidação da MO com dicromato é amplamente utilizada no Brasil, gerando resíduos laboratoriais que contêm Cr. Este trabalho teve por objetivo avaliar o método da perda de massa por ignição (PMI), em comparação ao método da combustão úmida usando a solução sulfocrômica, utilizado na Rede Oficial de Laboratórios de Análise de Solo e de Tecido Vegetal dos Estados do Rio Grande do Sul e de Santa Catarina (ROLAS). Os resultados obtidos com a PMI também foram comparados com os do método-padrão de Walkley-Black, que também emprega o dicromato. Foram utilizados os resultados de amostras de solo de 19 unidades de mapeamento do Rio Grande do Sul (RS) e de 49 amostras da Depressão Central deste Estado. As 19 amostras incluíram: Vertissolo (1), Gleissolos (2), Argissolos (6), Luvissolo (1), Neossolo (1), Latossolos (3), Plintossolo (1), Planossolo (1), Alissolo (1), Nitossolo (1) e Chernossolo (1). As amostras da Depressão Central foram obtidas no Laboratório de Solos da Federal University of Santa Maria. Os teores de MO determinados com a PMI foram, em média, 22 a 94 % maiores que os da solução sulfocrômica e 27 a 46 % maiores que os obtidos com o Walkley-Black, nas amostras da Depressão Central e nas unidades de mapeamento do RS, respectivamente. Houve correlação significativa entre a PMI e os métodos com dicromato. Os resultados indicam que o método PMI pode ser usado na análise do teor de MO do solo em substituição aos que empregam o dicromato. Para isso, equações que possibilitam calcular o teor de MO usando a PMI devem ser desenvolvidas para a maioria das classes de solos do RS.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic matter is known to contain a stable fraction with an old radiocarbon age. Size and stabilisation processes leading to the formation of this old soil carbon pool are still unclear. Our study aims to di?erentiate old organic matter from young and labile carbon compounds in two acid forest soils (dystric cambisol, haplic podzol). To identify such fractions soil samples were exposed to oxidation with Na 2 S 2 O 8 and to dissolution by hydro?uoric acid (HF). A negative correlation between 14 C activity and carbon release after dissolution of the mineral matrix by HF indicates a strong association of stabilised carbon compounds with the mineral phase. A negative correlation between the 14 C activity and the relative proportion of carbon resistant to oxidation by Na 2 S 2 O 8 shows that young carbon is removed preferentially by this treatment. The fraction remaining after oxidation represents a certain stabilised, long residence time carbon pool. This old fraction comprises between 1 and 30% of the total soil organic carbon in the surface hor- izons, but reaches up to 80% in the sub-surface horizons. Old OC is mainly stabilised by organo-mineral associations with clay minerals and/or iron oxides, whereas intercalation in clay minerals was not found to be important.},

  Abstract                 = {Phytoremediation, the use of plants to extract contaminants from soils and groundwater, is a promising approach for cleaning up soils contaminated with heavy metals. However its use is limited by the time required for plant growth, the nutrient supply and, moreover, by the limited metal uptake capacity. Synthetic chelators have shown positive e?ects in enhancing heavy metal extraction, but they have also revealed several negative side-e?ects. The objective of this study was to investigate the use of three natural low molecular weight organic acids (NLMWOA) (citric, oxalic, and tartaric acid) as an alternative to synthetic chelators. Slurry-, column-, toxicity- and phytoextraction experiments were per- formed. For the phytoextraction experiment the three NLMWOA were applied to a copper- and a lead-contaminated soil respectively. A signi?cant increase in copper uptake was visible only in the citric acid treatment (67 mg kg 1 ) in comparison to the EDTA treatment (42 mg kg 1 ). The NLMWOA application showed no enhanced e?ect concerning the lead phytoextraction. A possible explanation for this lack of signi?cance could be the rate of the degradation of NLMWOA. This rate might well be too high for these heavy metals with low mobility and bioavailability such as lead. The amounts of NLMWOA applied to the soil were very high (62.5 mmol kg 1 of soil) and the e?ect was too little. In this respect EDTA, which was applied in very small amounts (0.125 mmol kg 1 ) was more e?cient. Thus making NLMWOA unsuitable to enhance phytoextraction of heavy metals from soil.},

  Abstract                 = {Avaliações de produção de sedimentos em bacias hidrográficas são necessárias quando se deseja melhorar a qualidade da análise técnica, contribuindo para uma avaliação consistente da disponibilidade hídrica e, consequentemente, para a gestão dos recursos hídricos. O objetivo geral da pesquisa foi avaliar a produção de sedimentos em bacias hidrográficas sob a influência de diferentes contextos geoambientais. Três pequenas bacias foram monitoradas: a Bacia Experimental de Aiuaba, com área de drenagem de 12,0 km 2 , localizada em uma área de conservação ambiental do bioma caatinga, no sertão dos Inhamus, sob clima semi-árido; e as Bacias de Pai João (9,3 km 2 ) e Santo Antônio (6,8 km 2 ), localizadas no maciço de Baturité, sob clima tropical sub-úmido, que se encontram impactadas por ações antrópicas, particularmente agricultura. A caracterização das bacias mostrou que Aiuaba, Pai João e Santo Antônio têm respectivamente, percentual de cobertura vegetal natural de 100%, 86% e 76% e regime predominante de escoamento efêmero, intermitente e perene. Realizou-se monitoramento no ano de 2007, de variáveis hidrossedimentológicas nestas áreas. A estimativa anual de produção de sedimentos foi feita através da determinação de descargas líquidas e sólidas afluentes no exutório, e de equações de curvas-chave de sedimentos a partir destes dados. Nas bacias de Pai João e Santo Antônio, as cargas de leito foram estimadas por meio de simulação com o modelo EB (equações de Einstein e Brown), por não ter sido possível a medição desta parcela. Realizou-se ainda avaliação do modelo HIDROSED2 na estimativa de produção de sedimentos nas áreas. Na bacia de Aiuaba realizou-se simulação para o período de 2003 a 2007 e os resultados foram comparados com os medidos indiretamente (curva-chave). Nas Bacias de Pai João e Santo Antônio o modelo foi apenas calibrado, com base em alguns eventos monitorados em 2007. Na avaliação da produção de sedimentos nas bacias de Aiuaba, Pai João e Santo Antônio, os valores obtidos foram respectivamente 1, 136 e 686 ton.km -2 .ano -1 . Observa-se que a ordem de grandeza da produção de sedimentos aumenta com o nível de degradação ambiental. Entretanto, não é possível traçar conclusões unicamente em função do uso do solo, pois outros fatores influenciam a produção de sedimentos. Na avaliação individual de eventos nas três bacias o modelo HIDROSED2 não apresentou resultados satisfatórios para os pequenos eventos. Por outro lado, na estimativa anual e de eventos intensos de produção de sedimentos o modelo apresentou resultados satisfatórios em comparação com as medidas. Os resultados sugerem: (1) foi verificada correlação direta entre a degradação ambiental e a produção de sedimentos quantificada nas bacias estudadas; (2) a modelagem deve ser aprimorada com base na física de processos; (3) ainda há necessidade de monitoramento de variáveis hidrológicas e sedimentológicas com a elaboração de bancos de dados em bacias hidrográficas do Estado do Ceará, contribuindo para a implantação de instrumentos de gestão dos recursos hídricos.},

  Abstract                 = {A point of view as well as a collection of techniques is advocated here. The techniques - in this case a series of diagnostics - can be formulated and illustrated explicitly. The spirit in which they are developed, however, is more difficult to convey. Given a point of view, techniques that support it may be replaced quite easily; the converse seldom is true. An effort will be made, therefore, to summarize our approach to multicollinearity and to contrast it with alternative views of the problem. Multicollinearity as defined here is a statistical, rather than a mathematical condition. As such, one thinks, and speaks, in terms of the problem's severity rather than of its existence or non-existence. As viewed here, multicollinearity is a property of the independent variable set alone. No account whatever is taken of the extent, or even the existence, of dependence between y and X. It is true, of course, that the effect on estimation and specification of interdependence in X - reflected by variances of estimated regression coefficient, and a tendency toward misspecification - also depends partly on the strength of dependence between y and X. In order to treat the problem, however, it is important to distinguish between nature and effects, and to develop diagnostics based on the former. In our view an independent variable set X is not less multicollinear if related to one dependent variable than if related to another, even though its effects may be more serious in one case than the other. Of multicollinearity's effects on the structural integrity of estimated econometric models - estimation instability and structural misspecification - the latter, in our view, is the more serious. Sensitivity of parameter estimates to changes in specification, sample coverage, etc., is reflected at least partially in the standard deviations of estimated regression coefficients. No indication at all exists, however, of the bias imparted to coefficient estimates by incorrectly},

Também foram coletadas amostras até a profundidade de 40 cm ao longo de dois transectos, para cálculo dos estoques de C e N das áreas. Foram feitas determinações de C e N para todas as amostras, e fracionamento químico de C para uma amostra composta da camada 0-20 cm para cada área. Foi observada redução de 28% no conteúdo de C na camada de 0-40 cm após 20 anos de cultivo. A proporção relativa das frações húmicas também foi alterada em função da introdução da pastagem. No cerrado nativo predominou a fração ácido fúlvico; sob pastagem de dez anos, humina; e sob pastagem de 20 anos, ácido fúlvico novamente. Com relação ao nitrogênio, não foi observada diferença significativa nos conteúdos entre as áreas estudadas.},

Os resultados foram interpretados através do teste de t de Student e da análise multivariada utilizando o agrupamento não ponderado de pares e adotada a distância Euclidiana como critério de semelhança. Através do teste t de Student, não foi verificada diferença significativa entre as variáveis analisadas, exceto para estabilidade de agregados. A análise de agrupamento separou as amostras da face norte daquelas da face sul. Assim, ainda que estas diferenças sejam pequenas para justificar práticas agrícolas diferenciadas, pode ser interessante considerá-las em estudos pedogenéticos mais detalhados.},

  Abstract                 = {A multivariate statistical method (factor analysis of mixed data and hierarchical classification) was used to classify the environmental settings where sorted patterned ground develops in a wet oceanic periglacial area (Skagafjörður, Northern Iceland). A total of 750 periglacial features, distributed over 75 sites, were studied. Nine explanatory variables were assessed by fieldwork and using a digital elevation model, the variables were subdivided into three groups (latitude, topography and soil characteristics) and then integrated into a geographical information system. Furthermore, a correlation between the environmental variables and an intrinsic variable (patterned ground mesh diameter) was determined by a bivariate test. The results show that sorted patterned ground are spread over three homogenous areas, mostly differentiated by altitude, insolation, grain size characteristics and type of drift. In addition, feature diameters differ significantly from one group to another. Finally, it appears that patterned ground diameters are positively correlated with (i) the proportion of clay to medium silt content (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.35), (ii) altitude (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.51), and especially with (iii) clast length (r&#xa0;=&#xa0;0.97). This strong relationship with clast length is observed in each homogenous patterned ground area at both site and feature scales.},

As such, the teaching of Soil Science requires principles that reflect the nature of soil and the practices of soil scientists. Because no discipline-specific teaching principles could be found for Soil Science in the literature, an iterative approach was used to develop them, which involved input from students, academics, employers, graduates in the workplace, as well as published generic teaching principles. The synthesis of these perspectives was achieved via a series of cycles that first involved student feedback on Soil Science teaching from five Australian universities, combined with academic reflections on learning and teaching. The outcome of this activity was subject to perspectives provided by employers of soil scientists and practising soil scientists in the workplace. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of these sources and published generic teaching materials were blended into a set of 11 teaching principles of Soil Science that reflect the unique nature of soil and the outcomes required of graduates who have majored in Soil Science.},

Nos segmentos de baixa vertente, há ruptura nos processos de transporte e deposição dos sedimentos, sendo o perfil de solo da toposseqüência 2 um Latossolo Câmbico autóctone e, nas toposseqüências 1 e 3, perfis desenvolvidos a partir de materiais alúvio-coluviais depositados sobre o saprolito gnáissico. Apesar de a dinâmica evolutiva das três vertentes corroborar os modelos geomorfológicos tropicais até o segmento de meia vertente, a jusante, ruptura do coluvionamento na baixa vertente evidencia um recente desequilíbrio morfodinâmico.

Producers' perspectives have led to several measures of accuracy and precision that describe the intrinsic quality of the produced soil map and information system. These are described in some detail. In conclusion, it seems that adequate measures lack the ability to detect and quantify logical inconsistencies resulting from joining and harmonisation of existing maps. Additionally, indicators need to be developed that assess the semantic quality of maps while accounting for the taxonomic distance between the map units. Users' perspectives lead to a different view on map quality. Some minimal data sets of error are proposed that will enable users to incorporate soil map uncertainty into their applications.},

  Abstract                 = {The unique selling point of pedometricians still is close to their cradle: ability to map. Irrespective of the many scientific achievements one can ask if offering mapping ability, allbeit in various contexts, is all a pedometrician can do to bring forward soil science's broader agenda. This paper identifies, within some of the hotter issues on the soil science agenda, activities that need the input of pedometricians. Digital soil mapping (DSM) has reached maturity although some issues like the optimal use of legacy data still need attention. The necessary shift from DSM to digital soil function mapping implies an increased need for process knowledge in mapping, but also an increased focus of pedometricians on the strengthening of process models. Most quality issues related to DSM have a counterpart in process modelling, and some of these issues need elaboration to construct well-calibrated and complete models, e.g. by making motivated choices between the inclusion of processes or model reduction. Reaching out to stakeholders is also an issue of increasing interest, as these are confronted with uncertain concurrent models to evaluate future scenarios. Questions are raised such as: Does the need for a state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach imply a choice for one model and how should this be made, or is SOTA implementable as some weighted average of screened concurrent models. Can observations and model results be combined in decision making and what techniques are needed. The above issues are illustrated with existing examples and new material from soil science and beyond. As DSM and process modelling share common ground, mutual benefits can be expected at the interface of both research fields such as (i) increased usage of process knowledge in DSM and (ii) probabilistic approaches to less well understood soil processes. Stakeholders will profit from the development of decision frameworks to choose applicable DSM-techniques and the increased application of ensembles of DSM-methods and models to narrow prediction error bandwidths. Additionally, they will profit from the development of decision support systems filled with outcomes of scenario studies of multiple, uncertain, and concurrent models as these provide an interesting alternative to the application of one selected model.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional soil analyses are time-consuming with high cost and environmental risks, thus the use of new technologies such as remote sensing have to be estimulated. The purpose of this work was to quantify soil attributes by laboratory and orbital sensors as a non-destructive and a nonpollutant method. The study area was in the region of Barra Bonita, state of São Paulo, Brazil, in a 473 ha bare soil area. A sampling grid was established (100 ? 100 m), with a total of 474 locations and a total of 948 soil samples. Each location was georeferenced and soil samples were collected for analysis. Reflectance data for each soil sample was measured with a laboratory sensor (450 to 2,500 nm). For the same locations, reflectance data was obtained from a TM-Landsat-5 image. Multiple linear regression equations were developed for 50% of the samples. Two models were developed: one for spectroradiometric laboratory data and the second for TM-Landsat-5 orbital data. The remaining 50% of the samples were used to validate the models. The test compared the attribute content quantified by the spectral models and that determined in the laboratory (conventional methods). The highest coefficients of determination for the laboratory data were for clay content (R2 = 0.86) and sand (R2 = 0.82) and for the orbital data (R2 = 0.61 and 0.63, respectively). By using the present methodology, it was possible to estimate CEC (R2 = 0.64) by the laboratory sensor. Laboratory and orbital sensors can optimize time, costs and environment pollutants when associated with traditional soil analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The elevations recorded within digital models are known to be fraught with errors of sampling, measurement and interpolation. Reporting of these errors according to spatial data standards makes several implicit and unacceptable assumptions about the error: it has no spatial distribution, and it is statistically stationary across a region, or even a nation. The approach explored in this paper employs actual elevations measured in ground and aerial survey at higher precision than the elevations in the DEM and recorded on standard paper maps. These high precision elevations are digitized and used to establish the real statistical and spatial distribution of the error. Direct measurements could also have been taken in the field by GPS or any other means of high precision data collection. These high precision elevations are subtracted from values stored in the DEM for approximately the same locations. The distribution of errors specific to the DEM can then be explored, and can be used in the geostatistical method of conditional stochastic simulation to derive alternative realizations of the error modeled and so of the DEM. Multiple versions of the derived products can also be determined. This paper compares the results of using different methods of error modeling. The best method, which gives widely implementable and defensible results, is that based on conditional stochastic simulation.},

Digital models of elevation surfaces consist of files containing large numbers of measurements representing the height of the surface of the earth, and therefore a proportion of those measurements are very likely to be subject to some level of error and uncertainty. The collection and handling of such data and their associated uncertainties has been a subject of considerable research, which has focused largely upon the description of the effects of interpolation and resolution uncertainties, as well as modelling the occurrence of errors. However, digital models of elevation derived from new technologies employing active methods of laser and radar ranging are becoming more widespread, and past research will need to be re-evaluated in the near future to accommodate such new data products. In this paper we review the source and nature of errors in digital models of elevation, and in the derivatives of such models. We examine the correction of errors and assessment of fitness for use, and finally we identify some priorities for future research.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigated two approaches for large-scale analysis and prediction of the spatial distribution of soil properties in an agricultural landscape in the Canadian prairies. The first approach was based on the implementation of nine types of digital terrain models (DTMs) and regression analysis of soil and topographic data. The second approach used a concept of accumulation, transit, and dissipation zones of the landsurface. Soil properties were soil moisture, residual phosphorus, solum thickness, depth to calcium carbonate, and organic carbon content. The dependence of soil properties on topography was supported by correlations for the upper soil layer. However, topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus decreased with depth. Also, correlation coefficients and regression equations describing topographic control of soil moisture and residual phosphorus differed among seasons. This imposes limitations on regression-based predictions of the spatial distribution of soil properties. The prediction of soil property distribution with the concept of accumulation, transit and dissipation zones can be more successful and appropriate than the prediction based on linear regression. The variability in relationships between soil and topographic characteristics with depth may stem from spatial variability in the rate of decline of hydraulic conductivity with depth. Temporal variability in soil?topography relationships occurs because soil properties result from interactions of a variety of pedogenetic factors and processes marked by different temporal variability. In soil studies with digital terrain modelling, there is a need to take into account four types of variability in relations between soil and relief: regional, temporal, depth, and scale.},

First, we carry out a test for the precision of four methods for calculation of partial derivatives of elevations. We find that the Evans method is the most precision algorithm of this kind. Second, we produce formulae for root mean square errors of four local topographic variables (gradient, aspect, horizontal and vertical landsurface curvatures), provided that these variables are evaluated with the Evans method. Third, we demonstrate that mapping is the most convenient and pictorial way for the practical implementation of the formulae derived. A DEM of a part of the Kursk Region (Russia) is used as an example. We find that high errors of data on local topographic variables are typical for flat areas. Results of the study can be used to improve landscape investigations with digital terrain models.},

Its objective is the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic units and quantitative soil properties via the analysis of spatially distributed quantitative characteristics of soil-forming factors. Western pedometrists stress the scientific priority and principal importance of Hans Jenny?s book (1941) for the emergence and development of predictive soil mapping. In this paper, we demonstrate that Vasily Dokuchaev explicitly defined the central idea and statement of the problem of contemporary predictive soil mapping in the year 1886. Then, we reconstruct the history of the soil formation equation from 1899 to 1941. We argue that Jenny adopted the soil formation equation from Sergey Zakharov, who published it in a well-known fundamental textbook in 1927. It is encouraging that this issue was clarified in 2011, the anniversary year for publications of Dokuchaev and Jenny.},

Worldwide changes to forests, farmlands, waterways, and air are being driven by the need to provide food, fiber, water, and shelter to more than six billion people. Global croplands, pastures, plantations, and urban areas have expanded in recent decades, accompanied by large increases in energy, water, and fertilizer con- sumption, along with considerable losses of biodiversity. Such changes in land use have enabled humans to appropriate an increasing share of the planet?s resources, but they also potentially undermine the capacity of ecosystems to sustain food production, maintain freshwater and forest resources, regulate climate and air quality, and amelio- rate infectious diseases. We face the challenge of managing trade-offs between imme- diate human needs and maintaining the capacity of the biosphere to provide goods and services in the long term.},

The model is calibrated using observed hydrographs and sedigraphs by interactively changing the input parameters net capillary drive, initial soil moisture content, saturated hydraulic conductivity, cohesion, Manning?s n and the detachability of soil particles. Storms with characteristics similar to the calibration storms were simulated well, whereas the model did not perform too well for storms being significantly different. Simulation of soil loss was generally too high though the poor quality of observed soil loss made it difficult to assess the true performance of the model. Through a plus and minus 10% sensitivity analysis, it was revealed that the model was most sensitive to changes in the initial volumetric moisture content of the soil and Manning?s n and at the same time, the sensitivity analysis proved to be both condition- and site-specific in nature. Because of the difficulties of parameterising the model, it is recommended that in future applications of the model, minimum and maximum output values should be included as the output. Improved within storm modelling is needed, particularly to model conditions where crusting is widespread in the study area.},

Este trabalho teve como objetivo determinar o teor de C orgânico das substâncias húmicas e avaliar sua influência na separação de horizontes diagnósticos. Foram utilizados 56 horizontes diagnósticos de diferentes regiões do Brasil, 52 superficiais (H hístico, A chernozêmico, A proeminente, A húmico e A moderado) e quatro subsuperficiais (B espódico). Nesses solos, foram feitas a caracterização química e física, e também de C orgânico, da fração ácidos fúlvicos (C-FAF), fração ácidos húmicos (C-FAH) e humina (C-HUM), as relações C-FAH/C-FAF e C-EA/C-HUM (C-EA = C-FAF + C-FAH) e a percentagem das frações em relação ao C orgânico total (COT), sendo as variáveis submetidas à avaliação por análises multivariadas. Nos horizontes orgânicos, o H hístico apresentou maiores valores e equilíbrio entre o C-HUM e o C-FAH. Na maioria dos horizontes minerais, observou-se predomínio do C- HUM, seguido pelo C-FAH nos horizontes A chernozêmico e A húmico e pelo C-FAF nos horizontes A proeminente e A moderado. Nos horizontes B espódico, foi observado predomínio variável de C-FAF e C-FAH. Com a análise de variáveis canônicas, identificaram-se as variáveis que poderiam ser utilizadas para a separação dos tipos de horizontes diagnósticos. Usando a análise de agrupamento, separaram-se os tipos de horizontes com menor influência da matéria orgânica. Pela análise discriminante, obtiveram-se resultados satisfatórios na classificação dos horizontes diagnósticos com base nas variáveis das substâncias húmicas, quando comparados à classificação original. Os resultados das análises multivariadas indicam que a distribuição do C das substâncias húmicas pode ser utilizada para separar os tipos de horizontes diagnósticos ricos em C orgânico.},

Extractions involve the isolation of operationally defined double-deionized water (soluble), magnesium chloride (exchangeable), sodium hypochlorite (organic matter), sodium acetate?acetic acid (carbonate), hydroxylamine-hydrochloride?nitric acid (Mn-oxides), ammonium oxalate in the dark (AOD) (noncrystalline material), hydroxylamine-hydrochloride?acetic acid (Fe oxides), potassium perchlorate?hydrochloric?nitric acid (sulfidic), and hydrochloric?nitric?hydrofluoric acid (residual) fractions of the solid phase. Ferric Fe remained in the solid phase throughout the extraction sequence until its removal by hydrochloric?nitric?hydrofluoric acid (residual fraction). The hydroxylamine-hydrochloride (1.0 M in 25% [v/v] HOAc) extraction may underestimate Fe associated with crystalline materials. Thus, selective sequential extractions need to be optimized for a given soil prior to implementation and should be used in conjunction with spectroscopic techniques, when possible, to fully ascertain elemental partitioning within the solid phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Faults and lithological boundaries are pathways for focusing the large volumes of fluid required to form hydrothermal orebodies. The distribution of faults and lithological boundaries as a function of scale can be measured by the geological complexity, quantified by a fractal dimension obtained by box counting, that increases with complexity. Copper mineralisation in the Mt Isa Inlier has well-documented structural and stratigraphic controls, and may therefore have a strong relationship with geological complexity. In this study, a two-dimensional approach is implemented for analysing the relationship between complexity, complexity gradients and copper mineralisation. There is a strong positive relationship between complexity and copper distribution and endowment in both the major lithostratigraphic subdivisions of the inlier, the Eastern and Western Successions. This relationship may suggest that abundant fluid pathways and physico-chemical contrasts are critical factors in copper mineralisation. A weak inverse relationship exists between complexity gradients and copper endowment. At small scales, there is a departure from the fractal relationship between number of boxes containing faults or lithological boundaries and box size, called roll-off. Roll-off is shown to be a function of the detail of mapping. This allows variation in mapping detail to be accounted for in measurements of geological complexity by due consideration of the scale at which roll-off occurs. The results imply that complexity could be used as an exploration tool.},

  Abstract                 = {Mineralization in hydrothermal ore systems has proximity, association and abundance relationships with fluid pathways (e.g. faults and lithological contacts) based on the concept of deformation-induced permeability being localized along such features. To empirically calibrate the abundance relationship between these features and gold mineralization, a measure known as geological complexity has been quantified. A fractal dimension representing the degree of geological complexity is evaluated using a box-counting method on the combination of faults and lithological contacts on a series of maps over the Kurnalpi Terrane of the Archaean Yilgarn Craton. Using multi-scale geological datasets from the Kurnalpi Terrane, we show that geological complexity and its relationship to known occurrences of orogenic gold mineralization varies depending on scale and degree of interpretation of the maps analyzed. In terms of scale, stronger correlations are observed for higher resolution ?outcrop? geological and structural maps. Even when the percentage of outcrop was taken into consideration, the higher resolution maps still showed greater correlations between geological complexity and gold mineralization. Differing solid geological interpretations at the same scale significantly affect the degree of quantified geological complexity and its correlation with known gold mineralization. The study results also illustrate a negative correlation between gold mineralization and gradients in the geological complexity. This outcome is contrary to results obtained by previous workers, and indicates that geological complexity, rather than complexity gradients, is useful as an input predictor map for prospectivity analysis and exploration targeting in the Kurnalpi region and other regions containing similar orogenic gold systems. Furthermore, the results indicate that interpreted solid geology maps, while critical for manual conceptual targeting, may actually be less effective than outcrop maps as a predictive layer in automated conceptual and empirical prospectivity analysis.},

Although well publicized, only 2,244 bankruptcies occur in our data set of 2.9 million months of credit-card activity. We use stepwise selection to find predictors of these from a mix of payment history, debt load, demographics, and their interactions. This combination of rare responses and over 67,000 possible predictors leads to a challenging modeling question: How does one separate coincidental from useful predictors? We show that three modifications turn stepwise regression into an e#ective methodology for predicting bankruptcy. Our version of stepwise regression (1) organizes calculations to accommodate interactions, (2) exploits modern decision theoretic criteria to choose predictors, and (3) conservatively estimates p-values to handle sparse data and a binary response. Omitting any one of these leads to poor performance. A final step in our procedure calibrates regression predictions. With these modifications, stepwise regression predicts bankruptcy as well, if not better, than recently developed data-mining tools. When sorted, the largest 14,000 resulting predictions hold 1000 of the 1800 bankruptcies hidden in a validation sample of 2.3 million observations. If the cost of missing a bankruptcy is 200 times that of a false positive, our predictions incur less than 2/3 of the costs of classification errors produced by the tree-based classifier C4.5.},

  Abstract                 = {Numerous ecological studies use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) for exploratory analysis and data reduction. Determination of the number of components to retain is the most crucial problem confronting the researcher when using PCA. An incorrect choice may lead to the nderextraction of components, but commonly results in overextraction. Of several methods proposed to determine the significance of principal components, Parallel Analysis (PA) has proven consistently accurate in determining the threshold for significant components, variable loadings, and analytical statistics when decomposing a correlation matrix. In this procedure, eigenvalues from a data set prior to rotation are compared with those from a matrix of random values of the same dimensionality (p variables and n samples). PCA eigenvalues from the data greater than PA eigenvalues from the corresponding random data can be retained. All components with eigenvalues below this threshold value should be considered spurious. We illustrate Parallel Analysis on an environmental data set. We reviewed all articles utilizing PCA or Factor Analysis (FA) from 1987 to 1993 from Ecology, Ecological Monographs, Journal of Vegetation Science and Journal of Ecology. Analyses were first separated into those PCA which decomposed a correlation matrix and those PCA which decomposed a covariance matrix. Parallel Analysis (PA) was applied for each PCA/FA found in the literature. Of 39 analyses (in 22 articles), 29 (74.4 %) considered no threshold rule, presumably retaining interpretable components. According to the PA results, 26 (66.7 %) overextracted components. This overextraction may have resulted in potentially misleading interpretation of spurious components. It is suggested that the routine use of PA in multivariate ordination will increase confidence in the results and reduce the subjective interpretation of supposedly objective methods.},

Dentro dessa metodologia o semivariograma é muito utilizado na determinação da estrutura de variabilidade espacial e da amplitude da dependência espacial das variáveis em estudo. Basicamente o semivariograma mede o grau de semelhança entre amostras vizinhas, esperando-se que quanto mais próximas, espacialmente ou temporalmente, forem selecionadas as amostras, maior será a semelhança entre elas e, portanto, menor será a variância e quanto mais afastada menor será a semelhança, até que estas diferenças sejam atribuídas tão somente ao acaso. Este trabalho teve o objetivo de apresentar e discutir aspectos básicos do semivariograma na determinação da dependência espacial de variáveis aleatórias e aplicar a metodologia para um conjunto de dados georeferenciados. Discutiu-se a metodologia, suas restrições, suposições e aplicações. Pode-se concluir que o semivariograma permite determinar a amplitude de dependência espaço-temporal de variáveis aleatórias regionalizadas e que, quando a dependência espaço-temporal está presente, as estimativas são realizada com maior precisão utilizando-se técnicas geoestatísticas, em comparação com a estatística clássica.},

  Abstract                 = {Topography has been reported to be the major factor ruling the spatial distribution of Acrisols, Plinthosols and Gleysols on the seasonally flooded, low elevation plateaux of the upper Amazon basin occupied by Tertiary (Iça & Solimões) sediments. In this study, detailed morphological and mineralogical investigations conducted in a representative 25-ha site were combined with hydro-geochemical data to relate the vertical and lateral soil differentiations observed to the hydro-geological history of that part of the basin. As a result of the uplift of the Andes, several cuts in the extensive Tertiary marshlands have formed, at first, slightly incised plateaux of low elevation. There, weathering under hot and humid climates would have generated a reddish, freely drained and bioturbated topsoil layer and the vertical differentiation in subsoil sediments of a plinthite over an iron-depleted mottled clay. The second episode of soil differentiation is linked to the replacement of the forest by a savannah under the drier climates of the late Pleistocene, which favours surface runoff and the infill of the incisions by fine particles. This infill, combined with the return to the present humid climate, has then enabled the local groundwater to rise on the plateaux and to generate episaturation at the topsoil/subsoil transition close to the depressions. Nowadays, ferrous iron is released from the partly iron-depleted topsoil weathering front at high water levels during the rainy seasons. It moves from footslope to low-lying positions and from top to bottom in the soil profile according to the groundwater dynamics. The present general trend is thus to the lateral export of iron at high water levels due to subsurface and overland flows, its vertical transfer during the recession of the groundwater and accumulation in a nodular plinthite. In the latter, ferrous iron is adsorbed onto its softest iron masses where it feeds the neoformation of ferrihydrite that rapidly dehydrates into haematite.},

  Abstract                 = {Intensive field surveys were undertaken in two upland catchments in the UK, Plynlimon in mid-Wales and Glensaugh in North East Scotland. The survey was to examine the spatial variation across the area and to assess the accuracy of the database underpinning the soil carbon map for the UK. In each area three 1-km2 squares were sampled on a 200-m grid, with samples taken from both the organic and mineral horizons. Carbon stock was estimated, from the sample data, for each 1-km2 square and compared with values from the UK database for that square. The results showed large differences between some squares, particularly for Plynlimon. In this area, the overall discrepancy between field and database values was 45%, compared with 8% for Glensaugh. Various sources of uncertainty were examined, including bulk density, organic horizon depth, and the proportion of different soil types within a square. The value for bulk density, assumed to determine carbon stock, had a significant effect on the estimates. In both catchments the organic layer showed a gradual decrease in bulk density with depth, resulting in a large proportion of the carbon being stored in the top part of the profile. The soil types, mapped during the survey, also showed large differences from those previously identified for each 1-km2 square. This would have a considerable effect on the estimates of carbon stock within the UK database. It highlights that caution needs to be used when interpreting the UK soil map at this spatial scale.},

  Abstract                 = {The origin of the saline lakes in the Pantanal wetland has been classically attributed to processes occurring in past periods. However, recent studies have suggested that saline water is currently forming from evaporative concentration of fresh water, which is provided annually by seasonal ? oods. Major elements (Ca, Mg, K) and alkalinity appear to be geochemically controlled during the concentration of waters and may be involved in the formation of carbonates and clay minerals around the saline lakes. The mineralogy of soils associated with a representative saline lake was investigated using XRD, TEM-EDS, and ICP-MS in order to identify the composition and genesis of the secondary minerals suspected to be involved in the control of major elements. The results showed that Ca, Mg, and K effectively undergo oversaturation and precipitation as the waters become more saline. These elements are incorporated in the authigenically formed carbonates, smectites, and micas surrounding the saline lake. The control of Ca occurs by precipitation of calcite and dolomite in nodules while Mg and K are mainly involved in the neoformation of Mg-smectites (stevensitic and saponitic minerals) and, probably, iron-enriched micas (ferric?illite) in surface and subsurface horizons. Therefore, our study con ? rms that the salinity of Pantanal, historically attributed to inheritance from former regimes, has a contribution of current processes.},

Little information is available in the current literature on the occurrence and extent of these textural effects in semiarid soils of Argentinean Pampas. Separation of the primary SOM pools by particle-size fractionation were expected to contribute to elucidate how different SOM fractions could be affected by texture in Pampean soils. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the amount, quality and distribution of SOM fractions, either physically separated, i.e., particulate and mineral- associated SOM, or chemically separated, i.e. the humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) fractions of SOM, in the whole soil and fine fractions (silt and clay) of variously textured soils from semiarid grasslands in the Argentinean Pampas region. Furthermore, the influence of texture was investigated on the N and S status and distribution, also in relation to SOM fractions. The content of any SOM fraction showed a highly positive correlation with the fine fraction content of the parent soil. The amounts of N and S in particulate SOM were not affected by soil textural differences, whereas they decreased in the fine fractions and in HAs with increasing content of soil fine fractions. Fine-textured soils contained an amount of total N and S, possibly mobilized from SOM components of the fine fraction including HAs, which was larger than that occurring in coarse- textured soils. The HAs in the fine fractions of fine-textured soils featured a degree of aromatic polycondensation, a level of conjugated chromophores and a humification degree larger, and a molecular heterogeneity smaller than those of HAs isolated from the fine fractions of coarse-textured soils. An opposite trend was exhibited by the corresponding FAs. In conclusion, soil texture appeared to have an important impact on the amount, distribution and chemical properties of the various SOM components, and especially the HA and FA fractions, in Pampean grassland soils. As well, S and N mobility and availability in these soils was markedly influenced by textural differences.},

Distinguishing valley bottoms from hillslopes is an important first step in identifying and characterizing sediment deposits for hydrologic and geomorphic purposes. Valley bottoms occur at a range of scales from a few meters to hundreds of kilometers in extent. This paper describes an algorithm for using digital elevation models to identify valley bottoms based on their topographic signature as flat low-lying areas. The algorithm operates at a range of scales and combines the results at different scales into a single multiresolution index. This index classifies degrees of valley bottom flatness, which may be related to depth of deposit. The index can also be used to identify groundwater constrictions and to delineate hydrologic and geomorphic units.},

  Abstract                 = {TAPES-G is a grid-based terrain analysis program that computes slope, aspect, upslope contributing area, profile and plan curvature and several other topographic attributes for each cell of a square-grid digital elevation model (DEM). These topographic attributes can be used to represent key physical processes in a form simple enough to allow modeling at catchment and larger scales. The program creates initially a depressionless DEM if desired. Upslope contributing area can be calculated using either the classical D8 algorithm, the quasi-random Rho8 algorithm, the multiple flow direction FD8/FRho8 algorithm or Costa-Cabral and Burges's stream tube-based DEMON algorithm. Stream networks, sub-catchments and the spatial distribution of individual attributes can be plotted interactively or copied to the ARC/INFO geographic information system (GIS) for further processing.},

  Abstract                 = {WATER- as a liquid or vapor-is nearly always moving in the soil. It moves down­ ward following rain or irrigation. It moves upward to evaporate from the soil surface, or into plant roots and eventually into the atmosphere through transpiration. Horizontal movement also is important as for example when water moves out from an irrigation furrow. Water movement can be in any direc­ tion depending on conditions. Water flows through the open pores be­ tween soil particles. In an ordinary silt loam, for examp le, half the soil volume is pore space. W ater and air share this pore space. For most p lants it must be possible for air from the root zone to exchange with air from the surface. Air from the root zone is laden with carbon dioxide as a result of meta bolism in the roots. Pores in different soils vary in SIze and number. Silty and clayey soils generally have smaller pores but many more pores than sandy soils. Because of the number of pores, when silty and clayey soils are filled with water these soils contai n more tota l water than sandy soil with all its pores filled.},

Contudo, recentemente, o C tem sido determinado por métodos de combustão seca, como o CHNS/O. Este trabalho teve como objetivo comparar três métodos para determinação do C de solos cultivados com eucalipto em regiões com diferentes características edafoclimáticas. Foram comparados os métodos: Walkley-Black, Yeomans & Bremner e combustão seca (CHNS/O), utilizando amostras de diferentes classes de solos obtidas nas seguintes profundidades: 0?20, 20?80 e 80?130 cm nos Cambissolos; 0?25, 25?70 e 70?110 cm nos Latossolos; e 0?18, 18?50 e 50?110 cm nos Neossolos. Amostras de TFSA foram trituradas em almofariz, passadas em peneira de malha de 0,2 mm e submetidas aos três métodos de determinação de C. Os teores de C obtidos correlacionaram-se positiva e significativamente entre si. Os métodos Walkley-Black e Yeomans & Bremner tenderam a subestimar os teores de C em relação ao método de referência, CHNS/O, tanto no que se refere às camadas superficiais quanto àquelas mais profundas, com menores teores de C. Equações de regressão linear com elevados valores de R 2 permitiram transformar os teores de C obtidos por Walkley-Black e Yeomans & Bremner em C por combustão seca.},

Quantitative and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews, structured questionnaires and botanical plots highlight the constraints and opportunities associated with the use of Black Earth and Latosols among contemporary farmers. By identifying the strongest incentives for Black Earth cultivation today, and how many of these derive from relatively recent technological, politicaleconomic and ecological influences, it is possible to demonstrate how perception and use of these anthrosols are likely to have changed throughout history. Data indicate that important historical contingencies underlie the relative benefits derived from the cultivation of Black Earth through time, and are likely to have structured both pedological and cultural trajectories in site evolution. They also point to the conditions under which Black Earth is likely to have become an important economic resource. By demonstrating the historical specificity of human motives, it is possible to obtain a more complex picture of the conditions under which anthropogenic environments may have expanded or restricted the range of viable economic activities in the region, influencing site evolution.},

The organic carbon (OC) content of the grassland plot was 1.8 times greater than that of the similarly fertilized Ca(NO3)2 treated cropped plots. The comparison of two dispersion techniques (a low-energy sonication and a chemical dispersion which yield inherent soil aggregates) showed that increasing OC contents of the silt-sized fractions were not matched by a linear increase of silt-sized aggregates. This indicated saturation of the aggregates with OC and a limited capacity of particles to protect OC physically. Thermogravimetric analyses suggested an increase of free organic matter with increasing OC contents. Transmission FT-IR spectroscopy showed relative enrichment of carboxylic, aromatic, CH and NH groups in plots with increasing OC contents. The silt-sized fractions contained the largest SOM pool and, as revealed by 13C NMR spectroscopy, were qualitatively more influenced by the plant residue versus manure input than the clay fractions. Alkyl and O-alkyl C in the silt-sized fractions amounted to 57.4% of organic carbon in the animal manure treated plots and 50?53% in the other treatments.},

In this study, advances in the spatial representation of hydrological and geomorphological processes using terrain analysis techniques are integrated with the development of a field sampling and soil-landscape model building strategy. Statistical models are developed using relationships between terrain attributes (plan curvature, compound topographic index, upslope mean plan curvature) and soil attributes (A horizon depth, Solum depth, E horizon presence/absence) in an area with uniform geology and geomorphic history. These techniques seem to provide appropriate methodologies for spatial prediction and understanding soil landscape processes.},

A fração argila foi estudada por difratometria de raios X, análise termodiferencial, análise termogravimétrica diferencial e análises químicas. Os teores totais de Si, Al e Fe foram determinados após a digestão das amostras com água régia (mistura 3:1 de HCl 36 %: HNO 3 68 %). Nos extratos resultantes da extração com oxalato de amônio ácido (OAA) e ditionito-citrato-bicarbonato (DCB), determinaram-se os teores de Fe e Al. O teor de Si no material de origem e a posição dos perfis na paisagem foram importantes na definição da mineralogia da fração argila. O LBw e o LVdf foram classificados como caulinítico/goethítico e gibbsítico/ hematítico, respectivamente. Verificaram-se maiores teores de SiO 2 total e de caulinita (Ct) (373,3 a 574,3 g kg -1 ) para o LBw nos horizontes mais profundos (Bw2) e nos perfis mais baixos na toposseqüência. A maior presença de água associada à drenagem limitada no perfil 4 do LBw (ponto mais baixo da toposseqüência) favoreceu os maiores teores de óxidos de Fe e Al de baixa cristalinidade (OAA) e os menores teores de Fe 2 O 3 DCB (óxidos de Fe mais cristalinos). De maneira geral, não houve variação consistente nos valores dos atributos cristalográficos da hematita e goethita de acordo com a profundidade do solo e posição do perfil na toposseqüência. Os menores índices de cristalinidade da Ct foram verificados nas amostras do LVdf, associados ao maior teor de Fe total no solo (r = 0,79 ** ). O menor crescimento da gibbsita [menor valor do diâmetro médio do cristal no domínio (110)] foi observado no perfil 4 do LBw (posição mais baixa da toposseqüência).},

This study proposes the use of multiple logistic regressions on the prediction of occurrence of soil types based on reference areas. From a digitalized soil map and terrain parameters derived from the digital elevation model in ArcView environment, several sets of multiple logistic regressions were defined using statistical software Minitab, establishing relationship between explanatory terrain variables and soil types, using either the original legend or a simplified legend, and using or not stratification of the study area by drainage classes. Terrain parameters, such as elevation, distance to stream, flow accumulation, and topographic wetness index, were the variables that best explained soil distribution. Stratification by drainage classes did not have significant effect. Simplification of the original legend increased the accuracy of the method on predicting soil distribution.},

We present here numerical results illustrating that tests without the edge-effect correction proposed by Diggle (1979, Biometrics 35, 87-101) have a higher power for small sample sizes than those with correction. Ignoring the correction enables detection of departure from spatial randomness with smaller samples (down to 10 points vs. 30 points for the tests with correction). These results are confirmed by an example with ecological data consisting of maps of two species of trees in a West African savanna. Tree numbers per species per map were often less than 20. For one of the species, for which maps strongly suggest an aggregated pattern, tests without edge-effect correction enabled rejection of the null hypothesis on three plots out of five vs. on only one for the tests with correction.},

It is located in the Upper Paraguay River Basin, a major source of ?oodwaters to the Pantanal. The recent construction of a large dam in the upper reach of the Cuiaba? River raises questions: What will be the dam in?uence on the ?ood area and duration? What will be the consequence for groundwater replenishment and permanence of ?ow in the ?oodplain channels during the dry period? This study of the Cuiaba? River, within the Pantanal, describes water ?ow between the river channel and its adjacent ?oodplain, as well as relations between the surface water and groundwater near the river. Flooding of the plain adjacent to the Cuiaba? River critically depends on the river stage and proceeds through a complex hydrographic network. No free water table was encountered; groundwater was con?ned below clay?silt layers. Two groundwater bodies were distinguished based on their piezometric behavior. In both cases the river stage variations appeared to control the piezometric heads and the ?ood was the main recharge source. The groundwater moved from the river towards the ?oodplain where it appeared to sustain channel ?ow and to maintain soil humidity in depressed areas during the dry period.},

Dois métodos atualmente são utlizados para avaliar os estoques de C no solo. Esse trabalho tem como objetivo, comparar os métodos da camada equivalente e massa equivalente para os cálculos do estoque de C orgânico no solo e sua utilização em experimentos que incluam pisoteio bovino. No experimento foi conduzido no município de Jarí ? Rs , no período que vai do ano 2001 até o ano 2005. O pisoteio bovino causa uma aumento nos valores da densidade do solo, e isso gera um reflexo direto na massa de solo ,alterando assim de maneira dicisiva a determinação dos estoques de C orgânico se o método utilizado for o da camada equivalente. Porem quando se adota o método da massa equivalente, o ajustamento da espessura da camada do solo avaliada, os efeitos do pisoteio bovino são suprimidos. Os resultados encontrados demonstram a impotância do cálculo dos estoques de C orgânico ser feito utilizando o método da massa equivalente de solo, a qual elimina o efeito dos sistemas de uso e manejo na densidade do solo.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil-landscape models were developed to predict the spatial distribution of soil texture at the surface horizon across a catchment in southeastern Nigeria. A discretised thin-plate spline technique, in conjunction with a connected drainage-enforcement algorithm supplemented with the incorporation of ridge and stream-line data, was used to ensure proper hydrogeomorphic properties of the output Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Terrain attributes were derived from the resulting DEM. Stepwise multiple-linear regression was performed on the normalised terrain attributes and on the principal components constructed from the normalised terrain attributes to avoid multi-collinearity. The derived soil-landscape models were used to predict clay, silt, sand, ironstone and thickness of the surface horizon from the original terrain attributes for the entire study area (R2=0.41 to 0.75). The models were further validated using statistical criteria. Only for the soil variable clay did the soil-landscape model improve after stratification according to geological formation (R2 increased from 0.47 to 0.76). Cell-based algorithms were used to map the soil-landscape models spatially. The resulting spatial patterns correctly showed a significant relationship with the terrain attributes. This relationship is useful when studying patterns of sediment movement.},

  Abstract                 = {Uncertainties in soil organic carbon (SOC) stock assessments are rarely quantified even though they are critical in determining the significance of the results. Previous studies on this topic generally focused on a single variable involved in the SOC stock calculation (SOC concentration, sampling depth, bulk density and rock fragment content) or on a single scale, rather than using an integrated approach (i.e. taking into account interactions between variables). This study aims to apply such an approach to identify and quantify the uncertainties in SOC stock assessments for different scales and spatial landscape units (LSU) under agriculture. The error propagation method (d method) was used to quantify the relative contribution of each variable and interaction involved to the final SOC stock variability. Monte Carlo simulations were used to cross-check the results. Both methods converged (r2?0.78). As expected, the coefficient of variation of the SOC stock increased across scales (from 5 to 35%), and was higher for grassland than for cropland. Although the main source of uncertainty in the SOC stock varied according to the scale and the LSU considered, the variability of SOC concentration (due to errors from the laboratory and to the high SOC spatial variability) and of the rock fragment content were predominant. When assessing SOC stock at the landscape scale, one should focus on the precision of SOC analyses from the laboratory, the reduction of SOC spatial variability (using bulk samples, accurate re-sampling, high sampling density or stratified sampling), and the use of equivalent masses for SOC stock comparison. The regional SOC stock monitoring of agricultural soils in southern Belgium allows the detection of an average SOC stock change of 20% within 11 years if very high rates of SOC stock changes occur (1 t C ha?1 year?1).},

Para melhor entendimento da pesquisa foram elaborados mapas temáticos como: Geomorfológico, Hidrológico, Hipsométrico, Clinográfico, Uso da terra x declividade <5% e <47% em dois períodos, 1995 e 2003, com a finalidade conhecer as transformações espaciais e ambientais neste intervalo de tempo e propor soluções de amenizar os impactos ambientais encontrados. Paralelamente através de entrevista foram constatados varias irregularidades como: despejo de lixo nas margens de rios e ao longo de estradas, esgoto despejado a céu aberto e desmatamento, ocupações irregulares formando pequenas favelas. No levantamento sócio econômico foi detectado que 31% do lixo é recolhido duas vezes por semana e 66% somente uma vez por semana. Os que depositam o lixo a céu aberto somam 62% e os que queimam somam 28%. Os esgotos 25% despejam á céu aberto sem nenhum tratamento ou canalizado em direção aos rios, destes entrevistados 45% produzem algum tipo de impacto ambiental.

The clays were Na- or Ca-saturated and freeze-dried before use. Critical coagulation concentrations (CCC) of all materials and mixtures were found to be pH dependent. The A1 oxide was flocculated at pH >9.5 and the iron oxide was flocculated between pH 6.0 and 8.2; i.e., flocculation occurred at pHs near the point of zero charge (PZC). The CCC of both the Na- and Ca-clay systems increased with increasing pH. The effect of pH was greater for the Na-kaolinite (flocculated at pH 5.8 and having a CCC of 55 meq/liter at pH 9.1) than the Na-montmorillonite system (having a CCC of 14 meq/liter at pH 6.4 and a CCC of 28 meq/liter at pH 9.4). A 50/50 mixture of Na-kaolinite and Na-montmorillonite behaved more like montmorillonite (having CCCs of 13 and 33 meq/liter at pH 6.2 and pH 9.0, respectively). The presence of either noncrystalline oxide decreased the CCC over that of the clay(s) alone; the decrease occurred at pHs >7 for AI oxide and at pHs >6.5 for Fe oxide. Aluminum oxide produced a greater decrease in CCC than Fe oxide, especially at pHs > 8. The effect of each oxide on CCC was greatest near the PZC, 9.5 and 7.2 for A1 and Fe oxide, respectively.},

Using ç-radiolysis of water, OH ¥ was generated in solutions of standard humic substances in quantities comparable to those produced on time scales of days in sunlit surface waters. The second-order rate coefficients of OH ¥ reaction with Suwannee River fulvic (SRFA; 2.7  10 4 s -1 (mg of C/L) -1 ) and humic acids (SRHA; 1.9  10 4 s -1 (mg of C/L) -1 ) are comparable to those observed for DOM in natural water samples and DOM isolates from other sources but decrease slightly with increasing OH ¥ doses. OH ¥ reactions with humic substances produced dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) with a high efficiency of  0.3 mol of CO 2 /mol of OH ¥ . This efficiency stayed approximately constant from early phases of oxidation until complete mineralization of the DOM. Production rates of low molecular weight (LMW) acids including acetic, formic, malonic, and oxalic acids by reaction of SRFA and SRHA with OH ¥ were measured using HPLC. Ratios of production rates of these acids to rates of DIC production for SRHA and for SRFA were similar to those observed upon photolysis of natural water samples. Bioassays indicated that OH ¥ reactions with humic substances do not result in measurable formation of bioavailable carbon substrates other than the LMW acids. Bleaching of humic chromophores by OH ¥ was relatively slow. Our results indicate that OH ¥ reactions with humic substances are not likely to contribute significantly to observed rates of DOM photomineralization and LMW acid production in sunlit waters. They are also not likely to be a significant mechanism of photobleaching except in waters with very high OH ¥ photoformation rates.},

In order to circumvent those limitations, such samples are often treated with hydrofluoric acid (HF) to remove paramagnetic material and to concentrate the amount of SOM. The main objectives of this study were to elucidate the impact of this approach on the resolution of the CPMAS 13 C NMR spectra and on the chemical composition of the SOM in the A and B horizons of four Brazilian Ferralsols. Therefore, those soils were subjected to up to eight successive treatments with 10% (w/w) HF. Each of those extractions resulted in an enhancement of the C content of the samples. A relationship between mass loss caused by the treatment and texture and mineralogy was observed. However, high losses of carbon occurred during the HF treatments, particularly in the B horizons, but no consistent alterations in the distribution of carbon functional groups were determined by CPMAS 13 C NMR, suggesting that preferential loss of specific carbon groups was not induced. The concentration of total and dithionite extractable Fe increased after two treatments for most of the samples. This may be best explained by the preferential dissolution of silicate leading to a selective enrichment of iron containing minerals. After four treatments, the Fe concentration declined considerably. After the second treatment, the spectral resolution improved. Considering the obtained results, it can be confirmed that the efficiency of the HF treatment is rather controlled by the number than by the duration of the extraction. We suggest that, for A horizons of Ferralsols, four repetitions of HF treatment are sufficient to yield well-defined spectra. For their B horizons, on the other hand, the CPMAS 13 C NMR spectra obtained after four HF extractions were of poor quality, indicating that for these soils at least eight HF treatments have to be performed to acquire reasonable spectra.},

  Abstract                 = {Fractal analysis is now common in many disciplines, but its actual application is often affected by methodological errors which can bias the results. These problems are commonly associated with the evaluation of the fractal dimension D and the range of scale invariance R. We show that by applying the most common algorithms for fractal analysis (Walker's Ruler and box counting), it is always possible to obtain a fractal dimension, but this value might be physically meaningless. The chief problem is the number of data points, which is bound to be insufficient when the algorithms are implemented by hand. Further, erroneous application of regression analysis can also lead to incorrect results. To remedy the former point, we have implemented a convenient numerical program for box counting. After discussing the rationale of linear regression and its application to fractal analysis, we present a methodology that can be followed to obtain meaningful results.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an overview of the most recent developments in the field of geostatistics and describes their application to soil science. Geostatistics provides descriptive tools such as semivariograms to characterize the spatial pattern of continuous and categorical soil attributes. Various interpolation (kriging) techniques capitalize on the spatial correlation between observations to predict attribute values at unsampled locations using information related to one or several attributes. An important contribution of geostatistics is the assessment of the uncertainty about unsampled values, which usually takes the form of a map of the probability of exceeding critical values, such as regulatory thresholds in soil pollution or criteria for soil quality. This uncertainty assessment can be combined with expert knowledge for decision making such as delineation of contaminated areas where remedial measures should be taken or areas of good soil quality where specific management plans can be developed. Last, stochastic simulation allows one to generate several models (images) of the spatial distribution of soil attribute values, all of which are consistent with the information available. A given scenario (remediation process, land use policy) can be applied to the set of realizations, allowing the uncertainty of the response (remediation efficiency, soil productivity) to be assessed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the issue of modelling the uncertainty about the value of continuous soil attributes, at any particular unsampled location (local uncertainty) as well as jointly over several locations (multiple-point or spatial uncertainty). Two approaches are presented: kriging-based and simulation-based techniques that can be implemented within a parametric (e.g. multi-Gaussian) or non-parametric (indicator) frameworks. As expected in theory and illustrated by case studies, the two approaches yield similar models of local uncertainty, yet the simulation-based approach has several advantages over kriging: (1) it provides a model of spatial uncertainty, e.g. the probability that a given threshold is exceeded jointly at several locations can be readily computed, (2) conditional cumulative distribution function (ccdf) for supports larger than the measurement support (e.g. remediation units or flow simulator cells) can be numerically approximated by the cumulative distribution of block simulated values that are obtained by averaging values simulated within the block, and (3) the set of realizations allows one to study the propagation of uncertainty through global GIS operations or complex transfer functions, such as flow simulators that consider many locations simultaneously rather than one at a time. The other issue is the evaluation of the quality or ?goodness? of uncertainty models. Two new criteria (exceedence probability plot and narrowness of probability intervals that include the true values) are presented to assess the accuracy and precision of local uncertainty models using cross-validation. According to the second criterion, multi-Gaussian kriging performs better than indicator kriging for the hydraulic conductivity (HC) data set. However, looking at the distribution of flow simulator responses, sequential indicator simulation (sis) yields better results than sequential Gaussian simulation (sGs) that does not allow for significant correlation of extreme values (destructuration effect).},

  Abstract                 = {Indicator kriging provides a flexible interpolation approach that is well suited for datasets where: 1) many observations are below the detection limit, 2) the histogram is strongly skewed, or 3) specific classes of attribute values are better connected in space than others (e.g. low pollutant concentrations). To apply indicator kriging at its full potential requires, however, the tedious inference and modeling of multiple indicator semivariograms, as well as the post-processing of the results to retrieve attribute estimates and associated measures of uncertainty. This paper presents a computer code that performs automatically the following tasks: selection of thresholds for binary coding of continuous data, computation and modeling of indicator semivariograms, modeling of probability distributions at unmonitored locations (regular or irregular grids), and estimation of the mean and variance of these distributions. The program also offers tools for quantifying the goodness of the model of uncertainty within a cross-validation and jack-knife frameworks. The different functionalities are illustrated using heavy metal concentrations from the well-known soil Jura dataset. A sensitivity analysis demonstrates the benefit of using more thresholds when indicator kriging is implemented with a linear interpolation model, in particular for variables with positively skewed histograms.},

The interpretation of the distance ?(Pi, Pj) between the ith and jth members of the sample is discussed for some commonly used types of analysis, including both Q and R techniques. When all the distances between n points are known a method is derived which finds their co-ordinates referred to principal axes. A set of necessary and sufficient conditions for a solution to exist in real Euclidean sapce is found. Q and R techniques are defined as being dual to one another when they both lead to a set of n points with the same inter-point distances. Pairs of dual techniques are derived. In factor analysis the distances between points whose co-ordinrates are the estimated factor scores can be interpreted as D2 with a singular dispersion matrix.},

This paper gives a brief analysis of some principles: unambiguous algorithm, Applicability Domain (AD), and statistical validation. Some concerns related to QSAR algorithm reproducibility and an example of a fast check of the applicability domain for MLR models are presented. Common myths and misconceptions related to popular tech- niques for verifying internal predictivity, particularly for MLR models (for instance cross- validation, bootstrap), are commented on and compared with commonly used statistical techniques for external validation. The differences in the two validating approaches are highlighted, and evidence is presented that only models that have been validated externally, after their internal validation, can be considered reliable and applicable for both external prediction and regulatory purposes.},

While many researchers assume that the problem is universal, others question the assumptions, evidence, methodologies and scale upon which beliefs of soil decline are based. Reconciling competing visions of African soils requires a close examination of both farmer perceptions and scientific estimations of change at the local level. This paper discusses local soil knowledge in one small village in southwestern Burkina Faso and relates scientific measures of soil fertility to farmers? perceptions of soil types and changing soil fertility. Farmers? perceptions of soil types and characteristics match up very well with scientific investigations. It is with perceptions of soil degradation that differences occur. While farmers perceive that their soil is degraded, soil analyses show very little change. The goal here is not to argue that one type of knowledge is inherently wrong but to reconcile the two and see how and why differences emerge. Particularly important is a discussion of how contradictions emerge out of the social contexts in which perceptions at the local scale and beyond are embedded.},

SEC has very high correlation with soil texture, DEM contain valuable information on soil moisture regime and landscape genesis, and AP carry information on topsoil total organic carbon, TOC. We have developed a system that assists in identifying which auxiliary dataset should be used to determine each map unit boundary width, and thereafter express the boundary as a transition zone between two or more soil types. The method is developed using data from a soil survey on the island of Funen in Denmark and the concept is illustrated in a small strip in this area. A soil database with information on modal soils expresses the degree of drainage, texture and topsoil TOC in each of the mapping units, and we can thereby determine which parameters the bounding map units differ on, and in that way also which dataset should be used for calculating the boundary width.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial autocorrelation is the correlation among values of a single variable across a two-dimensional surface that are locationally referenced or tied together by an underlying spatial structure, introducing a violation of the independent observations assumption of classical statistics. Its many interpretations include a nuisance parameter, self-correlation, map pattern, a diagnostic tool, a missing variable surrogate, redundant information, a spatial process mechanism, a spatial spillover, and the outcome of areal unit demarcation. It can be quantified with various indices, including the Geary ratio and the Moran coefficient, the statistically most powerful of the two measures. These two indices are negatively related. Spatial autocorrelation can be portrayed with a Moran scatterplot. Most socioeconomic/demographic variables are measured at a geographic resolution that results in moderate, positive spatial autocorrelation. Satellite remotely sensed images tend to have strong to marked positive spatial autocorrelation. To date, few empirical examples of negative spatial autocorrelation have been reported, although it relates to situations of spatial competition. At the frontiers of spatial autocorrelation, work is dealing with it in massively large georeferenced datasets.},

  Abstract                 = { Negative spatial autocorrelation refers to a geographic distribution of values, or a map pattern, in which the neighbors of locations with large values have small values, the neighbors of locations with intermediate values have intermediate values, and the neighbors of locations with small values have large values. Little is known about negative spatial autocorrelation and its consequences in statistical inference in general, and regression-based inference in particular, with spatial researchers to date concentrating mostly on understanding the much more frequently encountered case of positive spatial autocorrelation. What are the spatial contexts within which negative spatial autocorrelation should be readily found? What are its inferential consequences for regression models? This paper presents selected empirical examples of negative spatial autocorrelation, adding to the slowly growing literature about this phenomenon. },

  Abstract                 = {Using spatial simulated annealing SSA , spatial sampling schemes can be optimised for minimal kriging variance. Two optimisation criteria are presented in this paper. The first criterion minimises the average kriging variance, the second the maximum kriging variance. In a simple case with 23 observations, performances of a sampling scheme obtained with SSA were compared with performances of a triangular grid. SSA reduced the average kriging variance from 40.64 to 39.99 [unit]. The maximum kriging variance was reduced from 86.83 to 53.36 [unit]. Starting with a preliminary, irregularly data set of 100 observations, an additional sampling scheme of 10 observations was optimised. This reduced the average kriging variance from 21.62 to 15.83 [unit]. The maximum kriging variance was reduced from 70.22 to 34.60 unit . As the kriging variance is considerably influenced by variogram parameters, their influence on the optimised sampling schemes was investigated. A Gaussian variogram produced a different sampling scheme than an exponential variogram with the same nugget, sill and effective range. Exponential, spherical and linear variograms without nugget resulted in irregular similar sampling schemes. A very short range resulted in irregular sampling schemes, with observations separated by distances larger than twice the range. For a spherical variogram, the magnitude of the relative nugget effect did not affect the sampling schemes, except for very high values (0.75) .},

  Abstract                 = {More than any other Mexican state, Chiapas dedicates the most hectares to certified organic coffee production, providing a means of survival for indigenous Mayan peasants. Organic coffee producers are restricted from using agrochemicals such as synthetic nitrogen fertilizers, thus depend upon soil management techniques to provide nutrients to their coffee crop. This study assesses farmer understanding of soil fertility enhancement processes that organic coffee producers use as a basis for decision-making and experimentation. Such processes include knowledge of leaf litter decomposition, composting, soil biology, and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF). Research for this study was executed in March through August 1999. Information was collected through 31 semistructured interviews conducted in three coffee-producing communities, Majosik, Tenejapa; Poconichim, Chenalho? ; and Tziscao, Trinitaria. Transcribed texts were coded and analyzed for content to uncover patterns in the farmer?s responses. Farmers? hybridized knowledge system included visible phenomena and information retained from organic training workshops. Farmers had an excellent understanding of the transformation from leaf material to soil and a good understanding of mineralization; however, the role of moisture influence, nutrient uptake, and soil organisms was not well understood. Nearly half of farmers thought that compost addition improved coffee plant growth. The significance of soil biology in decomposition was restricted to organisms farmers could see, especially earthworms. Soil microorganisms were rarely mentioned, and a lack of understanding of their role in soil processes was evident. Although more than half of interviewed farmers had seen root-nodules, farmer knowledge of legumes and the process of biological nitrogen fixation were limited. Results indicate that despite training attempts, farmers still possess knowledge gaps regarding phenomena that they cannot see, and future training should address unobservable ecosystem processes.},

By comparing the assumptions and use of classical sampling theory with those of geostatistical theory, we conclude that this view is both false and unfortunate. In particular, estimates of spatial means based on classical sampling designs require fewer assumptions for their validity, and are therefore more robust, than those based on a geostatistical model.},

  Abstract                 = {Real soil-landscapes are complex consisting of an inextricable mix of patterns and noise varying continuously in the space-time continuum. Soils and parent material show gradual variations in the horizontal and vertical planes forming three-dimensional (3D) bodies that are commonly anisotropic. There is no real beginning and end point in soil-landscapes because environmental conditions are dynamically changed through water flow, biogeochemical processes and human activities. The strengths of soil-landscape modelling lies in hypothesis testing, understanding causal linkages between environmental factors and their interrelationships within a spatial and temporal explicit context. To develop virtual soil-landscape models entails: (i) conceptualisation, that is defining the model framework (e.g. finite space elements); (ii) reconstruction, that is describing and quantifying underlying conditions and behaviour and (iii) scientific visualisation (SciVis), that is abstracting real soil-landscapes into a format that we can comprehend and that helps us to understand the complexity of soil-landscapes. The primary objective in data visualisation is to gain insight into an information space by mapping data onto graphical primitives. Capabilities and limitations of SciVis and virtual reality (VR) techniques are discussed in this chapter. Only recently 3D soil-landscape models have been emerging. We present a case study that translated the spatio-temporal water-table dynamics of a flatwood soil-landscape in Florida into a virtual domain using a geostatistical method to reconstruct the soil-landscape and Virtual Reality Modelling Language (VRML) enhanced with External Authoring Interface (EAI) for visualisation and implementation of interactive functions. Just as maps can visually enhance the spatial understanding of phenomena, interactive spatio-temporal applications can enhance our understanding of complex environmental systems and the underlying transport processes driving soil and water quality.},

Criteria for evaluating prediction equations, however, have generally concentrated attention on mean squared error properties of the estimated regression coefficients or on mean squared error properties of the predictor at the design points. If adequate prediction throughout a region of the space of predictor variables is the goal, neither of these criteria may be satisfactory in assessing the predictor. In this paper integrated mean squared error is used as a criterion to determine when the least squares, principal component, and ridge regression estimators of regression coefficients can produce satisfactory prediction equations in the presence of a multicollinear design matrix.},

An alternate method of estimating the parameters which was proposed by the authors in a previous paper is Latent Root Regression Analysis. In this article several comparisons between the two methods of estimation are presented. The improvement of Latent Root Regression over ordinary least squares is shown to depend on the orientation of the parameter vector with respect to a vector defining the multicollinearity. Despite this dependence on orientation, the authors conclude that with multicollinear data Latent Root Regression Analysis is preferable to ordinary least squares for parameter estimation and variable selection.},

There is an urgent need for effective and efficient methods to extract unknown and unexpected information from spatial data sets of unprecedentedly large size, high dimensionality, and complexity. To address these challenges, spatial data mining and geographic knowledge discovery has emerged as an active research field, focusing on the development of theory, methodology, and practice for the extraction of useful information and knowledge from massive and complex spatial databases. This paper highlights recent theoretical and applied research in spatial data mining and knowledge discovery. We first briefly review the literature on several common spatial data-mining tasks, including spatial classification and prediction; spatial association rule mining; spatial cluster analysis; and geovisualization. The articles included in this special issue contribute to spatial data mining research by developing new techniques for point pattern analysis, prediction in space–time data, and analysis of moving object data, as well as by demonstrating applications of genetic algorithms for optimization in the context of image classification and spatial interpolation. The papers concludes with some thoughts on the contribution of spatial data mining and geographic knowledge discovery to geographic information sciences. },

Whereas data quality, atmospheric effects, vegetation, and buildings contribute to the final result, the geometric model has a major impact. Seven geometric parameters should be explicitly defined: Viewer and target locations, interpretation of viewshed, point interpolation, point selection along radials, viewshed creation, vertical earth curvature, and horizontal earth curvature. The importance of horizontal earth curvature - the determination of straight line distance between observer and target - has not been sufficiently appreciated. Unless Universal Transverse Mercator approximations are valid, geodetic computations should be used. Because digital elevation models available to the military typically have a geographicbased point spacing, many established procedures that implicitly assume a conformal Universal Transverse Mercator grid introduce errors. A spaced radial algorithm produces the best weapons fans.},

  Abstract                 = {A sustentabilidade da produção de oleaginosas está na dependência das práticas agrícolas, sendo a erosão a mais preocupante forma de degradação do solo. Desta forma, desenvolveu-se um estudo no campus da UFSM, cidade de Santa Maria, entre outubro de 2007 e outubro de 2009, com o objetivo de avaliar as perdas de solo e água por erosão hídrica em sistemas de rotação de culturas oleaginosas e plantas de cobertura. O clima da região é do tipo ?Cfa?, com precipitação média anual de 1686 mm. O solo com declividade de 6,5% é classificado como Argissolo Vermelho Distrófico arênico. A unidade experimental constitui-se de uma parcela com dimensões de 3 m de largura e 15 m de comprimento. O delineamento experimental é inteiramente casualizado, com duas repetições. Os tratamentos consistem de três rotações: R1 (soja, aveia preta + ervilhaca, mamona + amendoim e canola), R2 (mamona + amendoim, nabo, girassol e aveia preta + ervilhaca) e R3 (girassol, canola, soja e nabo). Determinouse o rendimento da massa seca das culturas de verão e inverno, e a produção de grãos das culturas oleaginosas de verão. Realizou-se a amostragem e medição da enxurrada de cada chuva, sendo as perdas de solo e água calculadas, utilizando-se o programa computacional Excel. Os resultados de perdas de solo foram expressos em kg ha-1 e as perdas de água em % em relação à chuva. O índice de erosividade (EI30, MJ mm ha-1 h-1), foi determinado pelo programa Chuveros, a partir do qual se obteve a erosividade acumulada para cada período das culturas. Procedeu-se também a caracterização física (Dp, Ds, Pt, macro e microporosidade, DMG, DMP e distribuição do tamanho dos agregados em água), nas profundidades de 0-8 e 8-16 cm, e química (MO, macro e micronutrientes) nas profundidades de 0-5 e 5-20 cm. Aos valores obtidos, foi aplicado o teste de Tukey para comparação das médias dos tratamentos. Observa-se que a canola, quando comparada às demais culturas de inverno, apresenta uma redução significativa da MS no inverno de 2008 (R3) e também no inverno de 2009 (R1). Verifica-se que são superiores à produtividade de grãos das culturas da R2 (verão 2007/06) e R1 (verão 2008/09), ambas constituídas pelo consórcio entre mamona + amendoim, elevando significativamente o total de grãos produzido neste consórcio. Verifica-se em 2009, uma tendência de diminuição da Ds, DMP e agregados de maior tamanho, favorecendo as classes de menor tamanho. As alterações nas características químicas podem ser atribuídas à aplicação de corretivos e as modificações nos teores de MO que ocorrem em profundidade. As perdas de solo e água aumentam na medida em que diminui a MS adicionada pelas culturas. Mesmo que se considere a R3, onde se obteve as maiores perdas de solo (4641 kg ha-1) e água (23,33%), observa-se que os valores obtidos neste rabalho são baixos. A produção de grãos da soja e do girassol é significativamente menor que o cultivo consorciado da mamona com o amendoim.},

  Abstract                 = {Seasonally ¯ooded evergreen forests and non-¯ooded deciduous and semi-deciduous forests of the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil, were studied to compare their structure and ¯oristic composition, their production of small litterfall and its seasonal variation, as well as the nutrient input into the soil by fallen litter. The litterfall data were used to test the hypothesis that seasonally ¯ooded forests of the Pantanal are more productive than non-¯ooded forests. Eight permanent plots of 0.25 ha each were established in three forest types. The clayey forest soils had low N and P concentrations, a CEC from 20 to 190 mmol gÿ 1 and a pH from 5.1 to 6.6. All trees of  5 cm DBH were identi®ed and their diameters measured. Tree density and stand basal area ranged, respectively, from 368 to 1700 haÿ 1 and 15.5 to 25.3 m 2 haÿ 1 in non-¯ooded and from 725 to 2005 haÿ 1 and 22.1 to 32.6 m 2 haÿ 1 in seasonally ¯ooded forests. There were no signi®cant differences in stem density and basal area between non-¯ooded and seasonally ¯ooded forest. Species richness ranged from 4 to 17 per plot. Small litterfall (leaves, wood  2 cm, reproductive parts, trash<2 mm) was collected monthly over three years in 25 litter traps on each plot. Dry weights and element concentrations (N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Al) of litter fractions were determined. Concentrations of P, Ca, and Mg were highest in leaf litter from plots with many deciduous species. Accumulated Al (1.4%) was found in litter from Vochysia divergens Pohl. Element accession rates were low in deciduous and high in semi-deciduous and evergreen forest. Total litterfall in non- ¯ooded deciduous and semi-deciduous forest (4.86 to 7.71 t haÿ 1 yearÿ 1 ) was signi®cantly lower than in seasonally ¯ooded evergreen forest (7.53 to 10.27 t haÿ 1 yearÿ 1 ). The ®ndings show that, despite seasonal water excess being the prominent feature of the Pantanal, it is water shortage in the dry season that limits forest productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {The second edition of this book widens the scope of the methods and applications of Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis. We have introduced more up to date data sets in our examples. These give the text a higher degree of timeliness and add an even more applied flavour. Since multivariate statistical methods are heavily used in quantitative finance and risk management we have put more weight on the presentation of distributions and their densities. We discuss in detail different families of heavy tailed distributions (Laplace, Generalized Hyperbolic). We also devoted a section on copulae, a new concept of dependency used in the financial risk management and credit scoring. In the chapter on computer intensive methods we have added support vector machines, a new classification technique from statistical learning theory. We apply this method to bankruptcy and rating analysis of firms. The very important CART (Classification and Regression Tree) technique is also now inserted into this chapter. We give an application to rating of companies. The probably most important step towards readability and user friendliness of this book is that we have translated all Quantlets into the R and Matlab language. The algorithms can be downloaded from the authors? web sites. In the preparation of this 2nd edition, we received helpful output from Anton Andriyashin, Ying Chen, Song Song and Uwe Ziegenhagen. We would like to thank them.},

  Abstract                 = {The renaissance was an intellectually-rich period following a period of stasis in the medieval period. Something analogous appears to be currently taking place in soil science where novel approaches to thought are combined with a revival of ideas from the past. Renewed interest in agriculture (food, feed, fuel) and numerous publications have brought soils back onto the global research agenda. The need for up-to-date and fine resolution soil information and the revival of soil research has been highlighted and prioritised in several recent studies by the UN and other international organizations. Soil erosion, nutrient depletion and pollution are key issues that have been brought up in many recent reports ? in most cases in relation to environmental degradation, climate change and world-food production. There is also an increased interest in soils in the popular press and media, and soils have entered the policy arena in many countries and several continents. We guestimate that about €3.2 billion is annually spent on soil research in Europe, North America, and some of the main countries in Asia and Oceania. For the global soil science community, there are challenges ahead to address the questions raised in these reports. There is a whole set of new techniques and methodologies in the wings waiting to take centre stage. There is a direct need to educate a new generation of soil scientists and to increase the influx of soil science students in many universities. The soil science community should benefit from the current upsurge in soil science, but the community has to deliver the goods and information that is wanted and much needed.},

The SSSA Advocacy/Education Task Force met in 2007 and concluded that quantitative survey information was needed to document trends in soil science academic programs, student enrollment, faculty, and job opportunities for graduates. Suggested survey topics included: · Has the recognition of soil science as a distinct discipline increased or decreased? · How has the job market changed during the past decade, and how will job opportunities for soil scientists change in the future? · How have undergraduate and graduate soils curricula changed during the last decade? · Has enrollment in soil science degree programs and courses changed during the past decade? · Has there been a change in the degree programs of students enrolling in soils courses in the past decade? · Have soil science programs been combined with other programs? Therefore, the objective of the survey was to quantify trends in student enrollment, faculty positions, pertinent educational issues in soil and related sciences, and career or job opportunities and trends. Expected outcomes included a better understanding of current educational practices and trends, and identification of specific opportunities for SSSA to enhance the practice and profession of soil science.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil carbon stock changes are an important element in our attempt to understand and quantify the role of terrestrial carbon sinks. Unfortunately, the large spatial variability of organic carbon stocks in soils complicates their analytical quantification. At a heterogeneous forest site, we conducted a pilot study to estimate whether the choice of a suitable sampling design reduces the uncertainty of the stock estimate to an extent that permits the detection of carbon stock changes within a reasonable time period. Parent material had a strong effect on soil carbon stocks and stratified sampling of parent material classes reduced the error of the carbon stock estimate for the top 10 cm of the mineral soil from 3.1 to 1.7 t C ha?1. We estimated that replacing an unpaired sampling approach by a paired sampling approach could improve the detection limit of stock changes approximately by a factor of four. Despite these improvements, we estimate that about 15 years will be necessary to detect carbon stock changes in the top 10 cm if soil carbon sequestration occurs at the rate (0.43 t C ha?1 a?1) predicted by current carbon cycle models.},

High costs and limited opportunities for space? ight experiments hinder advances in reli- able design and operation of elements involving ? uids in unsaturated porous media such as plant growth facilities. We used para- bolic ? ight experiments to characterize hydraulic properties under variable gravity conditions deduced from variations in matric potential over a range of water contents. We designed and tested novel measurement cells that allowed dynamic control of water content. Embedded time domain re? ectometry probes and fast-responding tensiometers measured changes in water content and matric potential. For near-saturated conditions, we observed rapid establishment of equilibrium matric potentials during the recurring 20-s periods of microgravity. As media water content decreased, the concurrent decrease in hydraulic diffusivity resulted in limited attainment of equilibrium distributions of water content and matric potential in microgravity, and water con- tent heterogeneity within the sample was in? uenced by the preceding hypergravity phase. For steady ? uxes through saturated columns, we observed linear and constant hydraulic gradients during variable gravity, yielding saturated hydraulic conductivi- ties similar to values measured under terrestrial gravity. Our results suggest that water distribution and retention behavior are sensitive to varied gravitational forces, whereas saturated hydraulic conductivity appears to be unaffected. Comparisons between measurements and simulations based on the Richards equation were in reasonable agreement, suggesting that fundamental laws of ? uid ? ow and distribution for macroscopic transport derived on Earth are also applicable in microgravity.},

Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis results with the two sampling procedures are similar and stable across the three replicated samples. Poor performance of regression-based sensitivity analysis procedures for some analysis outcomes results more from the inappropriateness of the procedure for the nonlinear relationships between model input and model results than from an inadequate sample size. Kendall's coefficient of concordance (KCC) and the top down coefficient of concordance (TDCC) are used to assess the stability of sensitivity analysis results across replicated samples, with the TDCC providing a more informative measure of analysis stability than KCC. A new sensitivity analysis procedure based on replicated samples and the TDCC is introduced.},

The methods tested are the sum of cations displaced with 0.1 M BaCl2, and exchangeable Ba after saturation with BaCl2 and replacement with either MgSO4 (compulsive exchange) or MgCl2. The results show that when Al, Mn, and Fe are included with Ca, Mg, Na, and K in the sum of cations, this method gives the same result as do the other methods. It is recommended that this simple one-step method be used in routine analysis of acidic soils, especially when nonagricultural lands are under investigation.},

Such features as nonlinearity, collinearity, outliers, and points with high leverage can profoundly affect automated analyses, yet remain undetected. A n alternative technique uses interactive computing and exploratory methods to discover unexpected features of the data. One important advantage of this approach is that the data analyst can use knowledge of the subject matter in the resolution of difficulties. The methods are illustrated with reanalyses of the two data sets used by Hocking (1976, Biornetrics 32, 1-44) to illustrate the use of automated regression methods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses empirical and analytical rules to select a suitable grid resolution for output maps and based on the inherent properties of the input data. The choice of grid resolution was related with the cartographic and statistical concepts: scale, computer processing power, positional accuracy, size of delineations, inspection density, spatial autocorrelation structure and complexity of terrain. These were further related with the concepts from the general statistics and information theory such as Nyquist frequency concept from signal processing and equations to estimate the probability density function. Selection of grid resolution was demonstrated using four datasets: (1) GPS positioning data-the grid resolution was related to the area of circle described by the error radius, (2) map of agricultural plots-the grid resolution was related to the size of smallest and narrowest plots, (3) point dataset from soil mapping-the grid resolution was related to the inspection density, nugget variation and range of spatial autocorrelation and (4) contour map used for production of digital elevation model-the grid resolution was related with the spacing between the contour lines i.e. complexity of terrain. It was concluded that no ideal grid resolution exists, but rather a range of suitable resolutions. One should at least try to avoid using resolutions that do not comply with the effective scale or inherent properties of the input dataset. Three standard grid resolutions for output maps were finally recommended: (a) the coarsest legible grid resolution-this is the largest resolution that we should use in order to respect the scale of work and properties of a dataset; (b) the finest legible grid resolution-this is the smallest grid resolution that represents 95% of spatial objects or topography; and (c) recommended grid resolution-a compromise between the two. Objective procedures to derive the true optimal grid resolution that maximizes the predictive capabilities or information content of a map are further discussed. This methodology can now be integrated within a GIS package to help inexperienced users select a suitable grid resolution without doing extensive data preprocessing.},

  Abstract                 = {DEM error propagation methodology is extended to the derivation of vector-based objects (stream networks) using geostatistical simulations. First, point sampled elevations are used to fit a variogram model. Next 100 DEM realizations are generated using conditional sequential Gaussian simulation; the stream network map is extracted for each of these realizations, and the collection of stream networks is analyzed to quantify the error propagation. At each grid cell, the probability of the occurrence of a stream and the propagated error are estimated. The method is illustrated using two small data sets: Baranja hill (30 m grid cell size; 16 512 pixels; 6367 sampled elevations), and Zlatibor (30 m grid cell size; 15 000 pixels; 2051 sampled elevations). All computations are run in the open source software for statistical computing R: package geoR is used to fit variogram; package gstat is used to run sequential Gaussian simulation; streams are extracted using the open source GIS SAGA via the RSAGA library. The resulting stream error map (Information entropy of a Bernoulli trial) clearly depicts areas where the extracted stream network is least precise ? usually areas of low local relief and slightly convex (0?10 difference from the mean value). In both cases, significant parts of the study area (17.3% for Baranja Hill; 6.2% for Zlatibor) show high error (H>0.5) of locating streams. By correlating the propagated uncertainty of the derived stream network with various land surface parameters sampling of height measurements can be optimized so that delineated streams satisfy the required accuracy level. Such error propagation tool should become a standard functionality in any modern GIS. Remaining issue to be tackled is the computational burden of geostatistical simulations: this framework is at the moment limited to small data sets with several hundreds of points. Scripts and data sets used in this article are available on-line via the www.geomorphometry.org website and can be easily adopted/adjusted to any similar case study.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses the characteristics of regression-kriging (RK), its strengths and limitations, and illustrates these with a simple example and three case studies. RK is a spatial interpolation technique that combines a regression of the dependent variable on auxiliary variables (such as land surface parameters, remote sensing imagery and thematic maps) with simple kriging of the regression residuals. It is mathematically equivalent to the interpolation method variously called “Universal Kriging” (UK) and “Kriging with External Drift” (KED), where auxiliary predictors are used directly to solve the kriging weights. The advantage of RK is the ability to extend the method to a broader range of regression techniques and to allow separate interpretation of the two interpolated components. Data processing and interpretation of results are illustrated with three case studies covering the national territory of Croatia. The case studies use land surface parameters derived from combined Shuttle Radar Topography Mission and contour-based digital elevation models and multitemporal-enhanced vegetation indices derived from the MODIS imagery as auxiliary predictors. These are used to improve mapping of two continuous variables (soil organic matter content and mean annual land surface temperature) and one binary variable (presence of yew). In the case of mapping temperature, a physical model is used to estimate values of temperature at unvisited locations and RK is then used to calibrate the model with ground observations. The discussion addresses pragmatic issues: implementation of RK in existing software packages, comparison of RK with alternative interpolation techniques, and practical limitations to using RK. The most serious constraint to wider use of RK is that the analyst must carry out various steps in different software environments, both statistical and GIS.},

  Abstract                 = {The bibliometric indices of the scientific field of geostatistics were analyzed using statistical and spatial data analysis. The publications and their citation statistics were obtained from the Web of Science (4000 most relevant), Scopus (2000 most relevant) and Google Scholar (5389). The focus was on the analysis of the citation rate (CR), i.e. number of citations an author or a library item receives on average per year. This was the main criterion used to analyze global trends in geostatistics and to extract the Top 25 most-cited lists of the research articles and books in geostatistics. It was discovered that the average citation rate for geostatisticians has stabilized since 1999, while the authors? n-index seems to have declined ever since. One reason for this may be because there are more and more young authors with a lower n-index. We also found that the number of publications an author publishes explains only 60% of the variation in the citation statistics and that this number progressively declines for an author with a lower number of publications. Once the geographic location is attached to a selection of articles, an isotropic Gaussian kernel smoother weighted by the CR can be used to map scientific excellence around the world. This revealed clusters of scientific excellence around locations such as Wageningen, London, Utrecht, Hampshire, UK, Norwich, Paris, Louvain, Barcelona, and Zürich (Europe); Stanford, Ann Arbor, Tucson, Corvallis, Seattle, Boulder, Montreal, Baltimore, Durham, Santa Barbara and Los Angeles (North America); and Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Santiago (Chile), Taipei, and Beijing (other continents). Further correlation with socio-economic variables showed that the spatial distribution of CRs in geostatistics is independent of the night light image (which represents economic activity) and population density. This study demonstrates that the commercial scientific indexing companies could enhance their service by assigning the geographical location to library items to allow spatial exploration and analysis of bibliometric indices.},

  Abstract                 = {A computational framework to map species’ distributions (realized density) using occurrence-only data and environmental predictors is presented and illustrated using a textbook example and two case studies: distribution of root vole (Microtes oeconomus) in the Netherlands, and distribution of white-tailed eagle nests (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Croatia. The framework combines strengths of point pattern analysis (kernel smoothing), Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA) and geostatistics (logistic regression-kriging), as implemented in the spatstat, adehabitat and gstat packages of the R environment for statistical computing. A procedure to generate pseudo-absences is proposed. It uses Habitat Suitability Index (HSI, derived through ENFA) and distance from observations as weight maps to allocate pseudo-absence points. This design ensures that the simulated pseudo-absences fall further away from the occurrence points in both feature and geographical spaces. The simulated pseudo-absences can then be combined with occurrence locations and used to build regression-kriging prediction models. The output of prediction are either probabilitiesy of species’ occurrence or density measures. Addition of the pseudo-absence locations has proven effective — the adjusted R-square increased from 0.71 to 0.80 for root vole (562 records), and from 0.69 to 0.83 for white-tailed eagle (135 records) respectively; pseudo-absences improve spreading of the points in feature space and ensure consistent mapping over the whole area of interest. Results of cross validation (leave-one-out method) for these two species showed that the model explains 98% of the total variability in the density values for the root vole, and 94% of the total variability for the white-tailed eagle. The framework could be further extended to Generalized multivariate Linear Geostatistical Models and spatial prediction of multiple species. A copy of the R script and step-by-step instructions to run such analysis are available via contact author’s website.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the limitations of soil data is essential for both managing environmental systems effectively and encouraging the responsible use of soil data. Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with soil data, and their storage in a soil database are therefore important. In practice, users will not want to separate [`]uncertain data' from [`]certain data' and will therefore require a single database that meets all the requirements of a conventional database, as well as the ability to handle uncertain data specifically. This chapter presents a framework that facilitates the storage of information about soil-data quality, including the uncertainties associated with soil data, in a conventional database design. It comprises a methodology for classifying data according to their attribute scale, which influences the structure of an uncertainty model, and their space-time variability, which determines the need for autocorrelation functions in describing uncertainty. In terms of the former, the key distinctions are among real numbers on a continuous domain, real or integer numbers on a discrete domain, categorical data and narrative data. In terms of the latter, the key distinctions are among data that are constant in space and time (e.g. universal constants); data that vary in time, but not in space; data that vary in space but not in time; and data that vary both in time and space. Thus, we distinguish 13 [`]data types' to which individual datasets may be assigned. This simplifies the process of assessing uncertainties about soil data because characteristic uncertainty models can be defined for each data type. In general terms, an uncertain soil variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). However, the complexity of a pdf varies with the 13 [`]data types' identified. For example, the (cumulative) pdf of an uncertain numerical constant is simply a nondecreasing function on the real line. The database stores this function or some parameters of it, such as the mean and variance. Other data types are associated with more complex pdfs. For example, an uncertain categorical soil map requires the probability of each soil type occurring at any location to be defined (local uncertainty), as well as the spatial dependencies between these probabilities at multiple locations (spatial uncertainty). In practice, the complexity of the joint pdf will make it difficult or impossible to identify. Assumptions (such as a stationarity assumption) are therefore required to reduce the number of model parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {GeoPEARL is a spatially distributed model describing the fate of pesticides in the soil?plant system. It calculates the drainage of pesticides to local surface waters and the leaching into groundwater. GeoPEARL plays an important role in the evaluation of Dutch pesticide policy plans. This study analysed how uncertainties in soil and pesticide properties propagate through GeoPEARL for three representative pesticides. The GeoPEARL output considered is the 90th percentile of the spatial distribution of the temporal median of the leaching concentration (P90). The uncertain pesticide properties are the coefficient of sorption on organic matter and the half-life of transformation in soil. Both were assumed uncorrelated in space and were represented by lognormal probability distributions. Uncertain soil properties considered were horizon thickness, texture, organic matter content, hydraulic conductivity and the water retention characteristic. Probability distributions were derived from meta-data stored in the Dutch soil information system. A regular grid sample of 258 points covering the agricultural area in the Netherlands was randomly selected. At the grid nodes, realizations from the probability distributions of uncertain inputs were generated and used as input to a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation analysis. The results show large uncertainties in P90, with interquartile ranges larger than the median for all three pesticides. Taking input uncertainty into account also leads to a systematic shift of the P90 towards greater values. Stochastic sensitivity analysis showed that the pesticide half-life is the main source of uncertainty and that the coefficient of sorption to organic matter and uncertainty in soil organic matter contribute to a lesser extent. Uncertainty contributions from other soil properties were negligible. These results suggest that improved assessment of soil properties will only marginally improve the accuracy of the predicted pesticide leaching. Instead, more accurate assessment of the pesticide properties, in particular the pesticide half-life, is required. This is, however, difficult, because the pesticide half-life depends on highly variable soil microbial properties in a way that is as yet poorly understood.},

  Abstract                 = {Although environmental processes at large scales are to a great degree the resultant of processes at smaller scales, models representing these processes can vary considerably from scale to scale. There are three main reasons for this. Firstly, different processes dominate at different scales, and so different processes are ignored in the simplification step of the model development. Secondly, input data are often absent or of a much lower quality at larger scales, which results in a tendency to use simpler, empirical models at the larger scale. Third, the support of the inputs and outputs of a model changes with change of scale, and this affects the relationships between them. Given these reasons for using different models at different scales, application of a model developed at a specific scale to a larger scale should be treated with care. Instead, models should be modified to suit the larger scale, and for this purpose uncertainty analyses can be extremely helpful. If upscaling disturbed the balance between the contributions of input and model error to the output error, then an uncertainty analysis will show this. Uncertainty analysis will also show how to restore the balance. In practice, application of uncertainty analysis is severely hampered by difficulties in the assessment of input and model error. Knowledge of the short distance spatial variability is of paramount importance to input error assessment with a change of support, but current geographical databases rarely convey this type of information. Model error can only be estimated reliably by validation, but this is not easy because the support of model predictions and validation measurements is usually not the same.},

Data stored in a GIS will have been collected or measured, classified, generalised, interpreted or estimated, and in all cases this allows the introduction of errors.; With the processing of translation of this data into the GIS itself further propagation or amplification or errors also occur. It is essential that GIS professionals understand these issues systematically if they are to build ever more accurate systems.; In this book the authors decade of study into these problems is brought into focus with an account of the development, application and implementation of error propagation techniques for use in environmental modelling with GIS. Its purpose is to provide a methodology for handling error and error propagation.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding the limitations of environmental data is important for managing environmental systems effectively and for encouraging the responsible use of uncertain data. Explicit assessment of the uncertainties associated with environmental data, and their storage in a database, are therefore important. This paper presents a statistical framework for representing and simulating uncertain environmental variables. In general terms, an uncertain variable is completely specified by its probability distribution function (pdf). Pdfs are developed for objects with uncertain locations (?positional uncertainty?) and uncertain attribute values (?attribute uncertainty?). Objects comprising multiple space?time locations are separated into ?rigid objects?, where positional uncertainty cannot alter the internal geometry of the object, and ?deformable? objects, where positional uncertainty can vary between locations in one object. Statistical dependence is allowed between uncertainties in multiple locations in one object. The uncertainties associated with attribute values are also modelled with pdfs. The type and complexity of these pdfs depend upon the measurement scale and the space?time variability of the uncertain attribute. The framework is illustrated with examples. A prototype software tool for assessing uncertainties in environmental data, storing them within a database, and for generating realizations for use in Monte Carlo studies is also presented.},

This paper demonstrates how the standard stochastic theory of error propagation can be extended and applied to continuously differentiable arithmetic operations (quantitative models) for manipulating gridded map data. The statistical methods have been programmed using the Taylor series expansion to approximate the models. Model inputs are (a) model coefficients and their standard errors and (b) maps of continuous variables and the associated prediction errors, which can be obtained by optimal interpolation from point data. The model output is a map that is accompanied by a map of prediction errors. The relative contributions of the errors in the inputs (model coefficients, maps of individual variables) can be determined and mapped separately allowing judgments to be made about subsequent survey optimization. The methods are illustrated by two case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Nonlinear soil process models that are defined and calibrated at the point support cannot at the same time be valid at the block support. This means that in the situation where model input is available at point support and where model output is required at block support, spatial aggregation should take place after the model is run. Although block kriging does both in one pass, it is sensible to separate spatial aggregation from spatial interpolation. Contrary to aggregation, interpolation should better take place before the model is run because this enables a more efficient use of the spatial distribution characteristics of individual inputs. When a model is run with interpolated inputs, it is important not to ignore the interpolation error. Substituting conditional expectations in place of probability distributions into a nonlinear model leads to bias, essentially for the same reason that aggregating inputs prior to running a model is not the same as aggregating the output after the model is run. Running a model with inputs that are probability distributions will usually call for a Monte Carlo simulation approach. This causes a substantial increase in the numerical load, but apart from eliminating bias, an important advantage is that it shows how uncertainties in model inputs propagate to the model output. Many models used in soil science suffer not only from input error but also from model error, which is support- and case-dependent. Case dependency implies that model error can only be assessed realistically through validation. A major problem in validation is that the validation data are often collected at a much smaller support than the aggregated model predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {The soil mantles the land, except where there is bare rock or ice, and it varies more or less continuously. Many of its properties change continuously in time, too. We can measure the soil at only a finite number of places and times on small supports, and any statement concerning the soil at other places or times involves prediction. Variation in soil is also complex, so complex that no description of it can be complete, and so prediction is inevitably uncertain. Soil scientists should be able to quantify this uncertainty, and manage it. This means representing the variation by models that may be in part deterministic, but cannot be wholly so; they must have some random element to represent the unpredictable variation. Here we review three families of statistically based models of soil variation that are currently in use and trace their development since the mid-1960s. In particular, we consider classification and geostatistics for modelling the spatial variation, time series analysis and physically based approaches for modelling temporal variation, and space?time Kalman filtering for predicting soil conditions in space and time simultaneously. Each of these attaches to its predictions quantitative estimates of the prediction errors. Past, present and future research has been, is, and will be directed to the development of models that diminish these errors. A challenge for the future is to investigate approaches that merge process knowledge with measurements. For soil survey, this would be achieved by integration of pedogenetic knowledge and field observations through the use of data assimilation techniques, such as the space?time Kalman filter.},

  Abstract                 = {Research was conducted in northern Namibia to document and investigate the value of local knowledge connected with soil and land management, in particular with respect to the cultivation of grain legumes. Participatory approaches were used to describe and map the indigenous land unit (ILU) classification system in four villages. Soil and crop analyses indicated good correspondence between conventional productivity assessments and farmers? more qualitative descriptions of the ILUs. Patterns of land ownership were investigated to explore the relationship between the diversity of ILU land-holding, location and history of settlement. Results demonstrated that farmers have developed a sophisticated yet practical framework for managing their land that integrates knowledge of land type, productivity and optimum management under different rainfall scenarios in an unpredictable environment. The framework also clarified the perspective of farmers with regard to growing grain legumes. Their apparent reluctance was more often a pragmatic and rational decision to use the land for something more suitable. The authors conclude that an understanding of this framework offers real benefits to local professionals working for extension institutions and NGOs in agricultural development in northern Namibia, particularly in allowing the targeting of relevant interventions and support to specific farmer groups. It is likely that the practical approach to documenting and exploring the utility of local land-related knowledge systems used in this research has broad applicability in Africa and beyond.},

The main features of these datasets are reported from a geodetic point of view. Comparison at about 1 billion locations identifies artefacts (e.g. residual cloud patterns and stripe effects) in ASTER. For DEM-9S, the comparisons against the space-collected SRTM and ASTER models demonstrate that signal omission (due to the ~270 m spacing) may cause errors of the order of 100-200 m in some rugged areas of Australia. Based on a set of geodetic ground control points over Western Australia, the vertical accuracy of DEM-9S is ~9 m, SRTM ~6 m and ASTER ~15 m. However, these values vary as a function of the terrain type and shape. Thus, CGIAR-CSI SRTM ver4.1 may represent a viable alternative to DEM-9S for some applications. While ASTER GDEM has an unprecedented horizontal resolution of ~30 m, systematic errors present in this research-grade version of the ASTER GDEM ver1 will impede its immediate use for some applications.},

Building on Hutchinson's concept of the ecological niche, this factor analysis compares, in the multidimensional space of ecological variables, the distribution of the localities where the focal species was observed to a reference set describing the whole study area. The first factor extracted maximizes the marginality of the focal species, defined as the ecological distance between the species optimum and the mean habitat within the reference area. The other factors maximize the specialization of this focal species, defined as the ratio of the ecological variance in mean habitat to that observed for the focal species. Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are readily interpreted and can be used to build habitat-suitability maps. This approach is recommended in situations where absence data are not available (many data banks), unreliable (most cryptic or rare species), or meaningless (invaders). We provide an illustration and validation of the method for the alpine ibex, a species reintroduced in Switzerland which presumably has not yet recolonized its entire range.},

  Abstract                 = {Topography is an important control on hydrological processes. One approach to quantify this control is the topographic ln(a/tanb) index. This index has become widely used in hydrology, but it utilizes a relatively small portion of the information contained in a digital elevation model (DEM). One potentially important feature not considered in the implementation of the ln(a/tanb) index is the enhancement or impedance of local drainage by downslope topography. This effect could be important in some terrain for controlling hydraulic gradients. We propose a new way of estimating the hydraulic gradient by calculating how far downhill (Ld, [m]) a parcel of water must move in order to lose a certain amount of potential energy (d, [m]). Expressed as a gradient, tanad = d/Ld, values tend to be lower on concave slope profiles and higher on convex slope profiles compared with the local gradient, tanb. We argue that the parameter d controls the deviation of hydraulic gradient from surface slope. While we determine this subjectively, landscape relief, DEM resolution, and soil transmissivity should be considered at the selection of d. We found the downslope index values to be less affected by changes in DEM resolution than local slope. Three applications are presented where the new index is shown to be useful for hydrological, geomorphological, and biogeochemical applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Fractal-dimension analysis is an effective means of quantifying complex map patterns of structures and lithological contacts, which are conduits for hydrothermal fluid flow during the formation of orogenic- gold deposits. In this study, fractal dimensions, calculated on a 10 km grid across a geologic map of the Yilgarn Craton of uniform data quality, highlight relationships between geologic complexity and the location and size of Archaean orogenic-gold deposits. In the Kalgoorlie Terrane and Laverton Tectonic Zone, the largest gold deposits occur along steep gradients defined by fractal-dimension values. These steep gradients in the greenstone belts occur between assive sedimentary rock sequences of low complexity, and volcanic and intrusive rock units with more complex map patterns. The formation of world-class orogenic-gold deposits requires that hydrothermal fluids become focused from a large volume of well-connected rocks at depth, towards narrow, high-permeability zones near the location of deposit formation. Connectivity is indirectly related to permeability, and the degree of connectivity is related to the density and orientation of fluid pathways, which are quantified in map patterns using fractal-dimension analysis. Thus, fractal dimensions are a measure of the potential for increased connectivity and the likelihood of increased permeability. Greater complexity, as measured by larger fractal dimensions, implies that a certain area has the potential to produce more interconnected pathways, or zones of high connectivity. Therefore, the steep complexity gradients defined in the Kalgoorlie Terrane and Laverton Tectonic Zone correspond to areas that focused large volumes of hydrothermal fluid and enhanced the potential for significant gold mineralisation. Fractal-dimension analysis thus provides a link between empirical map features and the processes that have enhanced hydrothermal fluid flow and resulted in the formation of larger orogenic-gold deposits.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of model selection for geospatial data. Spatial correlation is often ignored in the selection of explanatory variables and this can inﬂuence model selection results. For example, the inclusion or exclusion of particular explanatory variables may not be apparent when spatial correlation is ignored. To address this problem, we consider the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) as applied to a geostatistical model. We oﬀer a heuristic derivation of the AIC in this context and provide simulation results that show that using AIC for a geostatistical model is superior to the often used traditional approach of ignoring spatial correlation in the selection of explanatory variables. These ideas are further demonstrated via a model for lizard abundance. We also employ the principle of minimum description length (MDL) to variable selection for the geostatistical model. The eﬀect of sampling design on the selection of explanatory covariates is also explored. S-Plus and R software to implement the geostatistical model selection methods described in this paper is available at www.stat.colostate.edu/ ∼ jah.},

  Abstract                 = {We have applied a decision tree analysis (DTA) to map soil, plant community and land unit classes across the Tiwi Islands (7320 km2), located in northern Australia. Our survey substituted environmental analysis and DTA for traditional air photo interpretation to provide a continuous land unit coverage over the islands. DTA was used to derive mapping rules for land units, their component vegetation classes and soil families from secondary survey site observations and distributed environmental data. The mapping was tested on a legacy data set. The environmental variables used are: elevation, slope, latitude, longitude, landform pattern class, wetness class, static wetness index, erosion or deposition index, Landsat TM band 5:7 and vegetation cover class extracted from digital topographic 1:50,000-scale mapping. We needed to reduce the number of the resulting land unit classes derived from historical surveys into nine classes so as to produce a more meaningful mapping. This was achieved by generalising the component vegetation and soil units of the land unit classes thus producing the broader land unit classification. This procedure dovetails well with the current survey approach in which surveyors often develop more detailed classification systems than can be accurately mapped. We recommend a predictive mapping approach based on explicit mapping rules that integrate available land resources information and facilitate production of upgradeable maps.},

We investigated the potential impact of error in a USGS 30&#xa0;m DEM on terrain analysis over 27&#xa0;km2. The difference in elevation between 2652 differential Global Positioning Systems measurements and USGS 30-m DEM derived elevations provided the comparative error dataset. Analysis of this comparative error data suggested that although the global (average) error is small, local error values can be large, and also spatially correlated. Stochastic conditional simulation was used to generate multiple realizations of the DEM error surface that reproduce the error measurements at their original locations and sample statistics such as the histogram and semivariogram model. The differences between these alternative error surfaces provide a model of uncertainty for the unknown DEM error spatial distribution. These DEM errors had a significant impact on terrain attributes which compound elevation values of many grid cells (e.g. slope, wetness index, etc.). A case study using terrain modeling demonstrates that the result of error propagation is most dramatic in valley bottoms and along streamlines.},

It is argued that location is the proper referent for soil observations and that operational definitions should apply only to the process of sampling and not to the creation of spatial bodies. An alternate pedon definition is proposed that spatially and temporally relates individual observations to a common point of geographic reference. This allows for the systematic assignment of one-, two-, and three-dimensional soil features to point locations as realizations of a sampling procedure.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil is a prominent component of terres-trial C and N budgets. Soil C and N pools are in?uenced by, and may reciprocally in?uence, many environmental factors. Our objective was to determine the quantitative relations of surface mineral-soil organic C, N, and C/N ratios to climate and soil texture across seven ecological regions that make up the conterminous USA. Up to 608 soil pro?les per region and their corresponding climates were evalu- ated with regression analysis. The organic C pool (kg C m 2 ) in the upper 20 cm of mineral soil was positively related to mean annual precipitation, evapo- transpiration and clay content in all regions. It was negatively related to a temperature/precipitation index in all regions and negatively related to mean annual temperature, except in the northwest temperate forest region. Soil C/N ratios were negatively related to clay or silt content in all regions. These relations are consistent with concepts of moisture and temperature controls on detrital production, differential effects of temperature on detrital production and decomposition, and stabilization of organic matter by clay and silt. Differences in quantitative relations among regions may be related to vegetation-composition effects on soil organic matter processes, clay mineralogy, and faunal mixing of surface organic horizons with mineral soil. Regional differences also occurred in the importance of climate vs. soil texture in explaining the variability in soil C. The regional differences indicate the importance of using region-speci?c, rather than generalized, equations for projecting long-term soil responses to climate change and for conducting ecosystem-model calibration or validation.},

  Abstract                 = {Inadvertent human intrusion is thought to be a significant, if not the most significant, threat to nuclear waste held in repositories. As part of the effort to access the safety of the first United States repository, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, New Mexico, four interdisciplinary teams of experts were brought together to provide insights into the modes and likelihoods of such intrusions as far as 10,000 years in the future. A formal expert elicitation process was used in obtaining their judgments. The teams provided scenarios that, although formed using different approaches, reflected several central themes. These themes are the uncertainty about the need for resource exploration in the future, the rate at which technology develops or declines in future, the likely failure of government control of radioactive waste sites, and the preservation and potential loss of memory about nuclear waste. Identifying possible futures enhances the ability to construct a repository that will be robust against many different potential threats.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a method to assess the uncertainty of an ecological spatial prediction model which is based on logistic regression models, using data from the interpolation of explanatory predictor variables. The spatial predictions are presented as approximate 95% prediction intervals. The prediction model is based on logistic regression analysis of field data of a wetland area in the central parts of the Netherlands. The model predicts block average probability of occurrences of 78 wetland plant species for 500 m×500 m blocks. The explanatory variables comprise groundwater chemistry, hydrological characteristics, and land use management. The uncertainty of the spatial model output is assumed to be a function of the uncertainty in the estimated regression coefficients and uncertainty in the interpolated values of explanatory variables. Monte Carlo analysis was used to assess the model output error due to uncertainty in both the regression coefficients and the explanatory variables. Correlation between errors in regression coefficients and spatial autocorrelation in explanatory variables are accounted for in the Monte Carlo analysis. Spatial patterns of the relative contribution of uncertainty of the regression coefficients to the total model uncertainty are presented. The patterns of the relative contributions of uncertainty to the total model uncertainty give information on the most effective way to reduce error, i.e. either by reducing uncertainty in the regression coefficients or in the interpolated input patterns. The spatial patterns and values of the 95% prediction intervals vary widely between species but are in general large and the relative contribution of the uncertainty of the regression coefficients is in general large (over 80%).},

  Abstract                 = {Recursive binary partitioning is a popular tool for regression analysis. Two fundamental problems of exhaustive search procedures usually applied to fit such models have been known for a long time: overfitting and a selection bias towards covariates with many possible splits or missing values. While pruning procedures are able to solve the overfitting problem, the variable selection bias still seriously affects the interpretability of tree-structured regression models. For some special cases unbiased procedures have been suggested, however lacking a common theoretical foundation. We propose a unified framework for recursive partitioning which embeds tree-structured regression models into a well defined theory of conditional inference procedures. Stopping criteria based on multiple test procedures are implemented and it is shown that the predictive performance of the resulting trees is as good as the performance of established exhaustive search procedures. It turns out that the partitions and therefore the models induced by both approaches are structurally different, confirming the need for an unbiased variable selection. Moreover, it is shown that the prediction accuracy of trees with early stopping is equivalent to the prediction accuracy of pruned trees with unbiased variable selection. The methodology presented here is applicable to all kinds of regression problems, including nominal, ordinal, numeric, censored as well as multivariate response variables and arbitrary measurement scales of the covariates. Data from studies on glaucoma classification, node positive breast cancer survival and mammography experience are re-analyzed.},

  Abstract                 = {We developed models from soil profile descriptions and GIS landscape analysis to estimate the spatial distribution of soil properties to assist soil scientists with soil-landscape information. Soil profile descriptions were obtained within soil survey projects in the Mojave Desert of southeastern California, USA. Sites were located on broad alluvial fans. Soil development varied from young soils with little or no soil development to well-developed soils on older alluvial fan remnants. We obtained a set of profile descriptions (n=264) from the traditional ongoing fieldwork. The location of these sample points was determined by soil scientist judgment of combinations of soil-forming factors. The project area is sparsely vegetated and access is relatively unimpaired in most areas. We feel that these purposive samples represent the range of the soil-forming factors and that sample location bias will be low. Although this bias is not measurable. We wanted to see if we could make use of these data. We developed models from these data and evaluated the performance of the models using the measured values at randomly located sites not used to fit the models. The models estimated selected soil characteristics continuously in a 30-m raster over the project area. The response variables that we modelled were soil genetic features that are used as diagnostic properties in USDA Soil Taxonomy, for example particle-size class, presence or absence of argillic horizon. Soil profiles and landscape features were described at 97 randomly located field sites within a portion of the active soil survey project. Explanatory variable information was developed for each of these sites through GIS extraction from digital elevation model data, landform derivatives, band-ratio satellite images and geomorphologic data. Model estimates for particle-size class were correct or within one class of the correct class for 73% of sample points. Models for depth to soil features had a range of performance. The best fitting model estimated the depth to secondary carbonates within 20 cm of actual depths for 71% of sample points, which contained carbonates. The model for depth to calcic horizon performed less well, while the model for depth to argillic was slightly less reliable. The model for presence or absence of calcic horizon was the most reliable logistic model. Soils on millions of hectares will be mapped in this general area in the future and we are trying to increase mapping efficiency and depth of understanding of soil-landscape relationships. Model development techniques will be adapted and applied to adjacent areas in the future. Further work will require more field data (to document the response variables) and more complete soil-forming factor spatial data. New soil survey products may result from these continuous raster estimates of soil properties. These model outputs are intended to augment and guide field soil survey data collection, not replace it.},

Composting was performed in two piles and the following parameters were measured in 10 samples during 122 days of composting: temperature, ash content, C/N ratio, water-soluble organic C concentration, and humic substance content (humic acid, fulvic acid, and nonhumic fractionÐHA, FA, and NHF, respectively). A spectroscopic method (Fourier-transform infrared [FTIR]) was used to study the chemical composition of the OM. The C/N ratio and ash content exhibited a typically high rate of change during the ®rst 49 days and leveled o? thereafter. Water-soluble organic C concentration rapidly increased to a maximum at Day 18 and declined there- after. The increasing level of HA at various stages of composting indicated the progression of humi®cation. The FTIR spectra revealed an increase in aromaticity and a decrease in carbohydrates as decomposition proceeded. Spectrometric measurements using FTIR provide information signi®cantly correlating to conventional chemical parameters of compost maturity.},

Sir Ronald Fisher saw the p value as playing a useful role in knowledge development by acting as an `objective' measure of inductive evidence against the null hypothesis. We review several reasons why the p value is an unobjective and inadequate measure of evidence when statistically testing hypotheses. A common theme throughout many of these reasons is that p values exaggerate the evidence against H0 . This, in turn, calls into question the validity of much published work based on comparatively small, including .05, p values. Indeed, if researchers were fully informed about the limitations of the p value as a measure of evidence, this inferential index could not possibly enjoy its ongoing ubiquity. Replication with extension research focusing on sample statistics, effect sizes, and their confidence intervals is a better vehicle for reliable knowledge development than using p values. Fisher would also have agreed with the need for replication research.},

An introduction of the two aspects of discriminant analysis (DA), descriptive discriminant analysis (DDA) and predictive discriminant analysis (PDA), are prefaced with a little history of DA. Aspects of the design of a DA study involving a DDA or PDA are discussed. Statistical preliminaries to a discussion of DA are presented. This presentation includes some of the basic mathematical and statistical concepts involved in a DA: matrix operations, distance, linear combination, probability, and statistical testing. The role of researcher judgment in data analyses and interpretations thereof is emphasized.},

  Abstract                 = {Concern over land degradation is not new, and is not solely the domain of geomorphology and soil scientists. Widespread and extensive reference to land degradation occurs throughout the world, and often has deep historical antecedents (Butzer, 1976b, 1982). There is increasing concern by a number of disciplines that land degradation has long term consequences to landscapes, and possibly society. In some cases land degradation is seen as a precursor and triggering mechanism to natural disasters, while social scientists have linked it to disruption of economic and political systems (Blaikie and Brookfield, 1987). Although the topic of land degradation is inherently interdisciplinary, because of its conceptual framework and intellectual breadth, geomorphology is an ideal discipline to address the multiple causes, management and prevention, and broader implications of land degradation. Moreover, because it strongly resonates with the general public, land degradation represents an opportunity for geomorphologists to communicate with a broad audience and make important societal contributions.},

Since this assumes a gradient, which is related to the goal, he calls it a goal-gradient. The shape of this gradient is shown, by reference to Yoshioka's experiment in selection of maze pathways by the rat, to be positively accelerated, and to conform to the logarithmic law. The author deduces ten actual behavior phenomena from his principle, such as choice of shorter path, order of elimination of blind alleys, relative rates of locomotion in different parts of the maze, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

We show that errors in slope and aspect depend on the spatial structure of DEM errors. We propose a general-purpose model of DEM errors in which a spatially auto-regressive random field is added as a disturbance term to elevations. In addition, we propose a general procedure for propagating such errors through GIS operations. In the absence of explicit information on the spatial structure of DEM errors, we demonstrate the potential utility of a worst-case analysis. A series of simulations are used to make general observations about the nature and severity of slope and aspect errors.},

The approach has given rise to a computationally efficient interpolation procedure which couples the minimization of a terrain specific roughness penalty with an automatic drainage enforcement algorithm. The drainage enforcement algorithm removes spurious sinks or pits yielding DEMs which may be used to advantage in hydrological process studies. The drainage enforcement algorithm has also been found to significantly increase the accuracy of DEMs interpolated from sparse, but well chosen, surface specific elevation data. Moreover, it facilitates the detection of errors in elevation data that would not be detected by more conventional statistical means and forms a sound physical basis for cartographic generalization.},

  Abstract                 = {Significant extensions to an existing finite difference approach to the interpolation of digital elevation models (DEMs) are discussed. The underlying finite difference computational structure is retained, but the minimum curvature interpolation criterion is replaced by a locally adaptive criterion which directly minimises profile curvature, that is curvature of the modelled land surface in the down slope direction. The new method should automatically match landforming processes and hence preserve drainage structure. It should remove biases in the representation of profile curvature which have previously limited applications to the analysis of erosion and soil forming processes. The local nature of the new interpolation condition should also permit greater flexibility in modelling landscape features, including breaklines and cliffs. A statistical analysis of the discretisation errors imposed by representing the landscape with a regular grid DEM leads to a method for optimal smoothing of both point and contour line elevation data. This in turn has led to a simple criterion for matching the spatial resolution of the DEM to the information content of the data, a practical advance toward addressing scale issues in hydrological and environmental modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {The H2O2 organic-matter-removal method (Jackson, 1985) used routinely to remove organic matter from sediments in preparation for dD analyses, was found to alter the dD of the smectite standard, H26, up to 28? and of Gulf Coast shale samples up to 213?. Before the H2O2 treatment, analytical error for the dD analyses was low ranging from 61? to 63?. After treatment the error increased ranging from 64 to 613? for 46% of the treated samples. This decreased reproducibility suggests the deuterium is no longer evenly distributed within the samples, and that the shift in dD may be the result of retention or removal of a hydrogen bearing phase. Total organic carbon (TOC) analyses of the shale samples before and after treatment with H2O2 show that up to 0.80 wt.% TOC remains in the samples even after the samples appear bleached, which according to Jackson (1985) indicates complete removal of the organic matter. An additional 24 h of treatment (two more additions of H2O2) or more, depending on the initial TOC content, was necessary beyond bleaching of the samples to achieve a final TOC of 0.10 wt.% or less. The dD values of the untreated Gulf Coast shale samples with 1 wt.% TOC or less, lie within a narrow range, 238 to 232?, and within this range lack any correlation with TOC, suggesting the presence of the organic matter is not effecting the dD values. A single sample with TOC greater than 1 wt.%, PB2?4762 m with 10 wt.% TOC, has a dD value of 256? outside of the range of the low TOC samples. Organic matter isolated from this high TOC sample was added incrementally to four of the other shale samples. dD analyses of these shale-organic matter mixtures show a decrease of 0.23? with each mole % increase in hydrogen from organic matter. By using this slope to calculate the dD of PB2?4762 m without the organic matter gives a value of 240?. This new value is within 2? of the range of values for the low TOC shales, 238 to 232?, and is within the analytical error of the dD analyses.},

A few have made such an analysis mainly using statistical distribution models. Comparisons with nonbiological classifications are needed to know if such structures are the result of biological evolution or of taxonomic practices, utilitarian bias, and/or subconscious cognitive rules. We compare the biological classification of a target group of soil borne plant parasitic nematodes (the Tylenchina suborder) with a non-biological one (the USDA 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy). The authors made use of the same tools used in previous papers by biologists introducing other classifications. The results show that both taxonomies are information systems that try to optimize the information flow and fit well to the same distribution models. The analysis does not show any idiosyncrasies of biological classifications with respect to pedological ones, thus, supporting the idea that these products are the result of subconscious cognitive rules used by humankind to classify the world.},

  Abstract                 = {A unidade de bacia é uma pequena bacia de drenagem, tomada como célula básica onde os processos pedológicos, impulsionados pelo movimento da água, são condicionados pelas formas de relevo. O objetivo do trabalho foi caracterizar o solo em uma unidade de bacia que não sofreu intervenção de atividades humanas há pelo menos trinta anos. O solo nessa área é desenvolvido de rochas sedimentares da formação geológica Santa Maria. Aspectos morfológi- cos, químicos,físicos, mineralógicos e hídricos foram analisados no sentido de relacioná-Ios com a distribui- ção do conteúdo de água em função das formas dos declives. Para tanto, foram locados quatro transetos em três declives (um côncavo-côncavo, um convexo- linear, um convexo-convexo) no campus da UFSM. Seis a nove pontos foram locados em cada transeto, totalizando 29 pontos, onde coletou-se amostras de solo até aproximadamente 2m para as análises quími- cas e físicas, nos quais foi monitorado o conteúdo de água com sonda de nêutrons. No transeto côncavo, foram abertas duas trincheiras para descrição morfo- lógica e coleta de amostras para caracterização da solução do solo e análises qUÚTIicas,físicas, mineraló- gicas e sedimentológicas. Nas condições do estudo, observou-se maiores conteúdos de água e diferencia- ção dos horizontes do solo no declive côncavo em relação aos convexos. No declive côncavo, o desen- volvimento do horizonte E se dá provavelmente pelo processo de ferrólise, associado à eluviação/iluviação, contrastando com os declives convexos, onde o horizonte E está em processo inicial de formação, provavelmente por eluviação/iluviação, não sendo possível, com base nos dados obtidos, descartar a contribuição da ferrólise. Também quimicamente o declive côncavo diferenciou-se dos convexos, apresen- tando maior concentração de H+ + AI+ 3 e Ar) em su- perfície, enquanto nos convexos a concentração desses elementos aumentou em profundidade. Entre os perfis analisados no transeto côncavo, um no terço inferior do declive, em posição mal drenada, e outro no terço superior, de melhor drenagem, foram observadas dife- rentes características morfológicas, químicas, físicas e sedimentológicas. O perfil inferior apresentou hori- zontes de coloração acinzentada e baixos valores de ferro total, indicando processo de redução do ferro, bem como sua saída do sistema. Já o perfil na posição mais elevada apresentou características que indicam ma maior atuação dos processos de intemperismo, associados à maior lixiviação, pela sua posição no de- clive. Estas variações nas características do solo estão associadas às diferentes formas de declives e posições de um mesmo declive onde se encontram e que condi- cionam a distribuição do conteúdo de água no solo.},

  Abstract                 = {Em 20 amostras hematíticas e goethíticas de horizontes B latossólicos, uma de B plíntico, uma de B incipiente e uma de saprolito, foram avaliados dois procedimentos de extração de óxidos de ferro pedogênicos (Fed) por ditionito-citrato-bicarbonato de sódio (DCB). O procedimento a 80 oC (DCB80) extraiu aproximadamente 90 % do Fed na primeira extração e praticamente a totalidade do mesmo na segunda extração, sendo mais efetivo que o procedimento a temperatura ambiente (DCB20), o qual teve sua eficiência reduzida com o aumento da substituição isomórfica de Fe3+ por Al3+ na goethita. A substituição isomórfica de Fe3+ por Al3+ na goethita determinada por DCB80 superestimou os valores determinados por DRX conforme aumentaram as extrações. Em amostras hematíticas, esta estimativa foi prejudicada pela presença de maghemita que dissolveu juntamente com a hematita.},

To gain acceptance in applications where the subsequent decisions have serious consequences, e.g. choice of cancer therapy, any such decision support system must come with a reliable performance estimate. Tailored for small sample problems, cross-validation (CV) and bootstrapping (BTS) have been the most commonly used methods to determine such estimates in virtually all branches of science for the last 20 years. Here, we address the often overlooked fact that the uncertainty in a point estimate obtained with CV and BTS is unknown and quite large for small sample classification problems encountered in biomedical applications and elsewhere. To avoid this fundamental problem of employing CV and BTS, until improved alternatives have been established, we suggest that the final classification performance always should be reported in the form of a Bayesian confidence interval obtained from a simple holdout test or using some other method that yields conservative measures of the uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {Human population pressures upon land resources have increased the need to assess impacts of land use change on soil quality. In order to assess effects of land use changes on soil quality properties in a tropical forest ecosystem of Bangladesh, soil samples were collected from adjacent well-stocked Shorea robusta natural forest, land reforested with Acacia, grassland and cultivated land. Land use/land cover changes (degradation of natural forest and subsequent cultivation of soils) resulted in surface compaction and significant decreases in silt and clay contents, porosity and aggregate stability, N, fulvic and labile C, and microbial biomass C. Maintenance respiration rates increased in comparison to the soils under natural forest. Use of soil deterioration index showed that soil quality deteriorated significantly (-44%) under cultivation, while in sites revegetated with fast-growing Acacia or grasses, it improved by 6-16%. Degradation of soil quality may have resulted from increased disruption of macroaggregates, reductions in microbial biomass, and loss of labile organic matter due to fire, deforestation, tillage and accelerated erosion. Improvement in soil quality and enhanced biological activity at reforested and grassland sites demonstrated the inherent resilience of these soils once revegetated with highly adaptable and fast growing Acacia (Acacia sp.) and grass species.},

Thirteen such intermediate properties were evaluated for potential inclusion in a soil quality index by comparing soils under contrasting management systems from long-term replicated field experiments and from paired field sites. Conservation (v. conventional) management was defined as some combination of reduced tillage, increased crop diversity, more perennial crops, increased crop residue return, increased soil fertility and/or increased application of organic amendments. Conservation management most consistently and markedly influenced soil quality indicator properties by increasing total and active microbial biomass carbon (C-TMB and C-AMB) increasing the ratio of active microbial biomass carbon to total organic carbon (C-AMB/C-ORG) increasing aggregation and decreasing the rate of basal respiration per unit of microbial biomass carbon (qCO(2)). The qCO(2) increased exponentially as C-TMB decreased. This may indicate reduced stress on soil microbial communities under conservation management and high microbial populations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper summarizes the approach and results of error propagation analyses in the Olše and Stonávka confluence area. In terrain analyses the outputs of the aforementioned analysis are always a function of input. Four different digital elevation model (DEM) resolutions (0.5, 1, 5 and 10 meters from LIDAR cloud points) were examined with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) rating up to 0.317 meters (10 m DEM). They all originate in LIDAR survey. In the analyses was performed a stochastic Monte Carlo simulation with 100 iterations. Article targets the error propagation for large-scaled area using high quality input DEM. The DEM data uncertainty (RMSE) was computed from samplings and ground research (RTK GPS). According to empirical error distribution it was used semivariogram to model spatially autocorrelated uncertainty in elevation. Second procedure modelled the uncertainty without autocorrelation using random N(0,RMSE) error generator. Based on Monte Carlo simulation method the initial DEM was repeatedly perturbed by the uncertainty. Finally, statistical summaries were drawn to investigate the expected hypothesis. As expected; the error in slopes is increased with the vertical error in input DEM. According to similar studies using different DEM input data, high qualitative LIDAR input data decreases the output uncertainty. Errors without spatial autocorrelation do not result to greater variance in resulting slope error. Therefore it should be challenged, if error propagation without spatial autocorrelation represents sufficiently the true state of the nature of the error representation. In this case; although the slope error results (comparing random uncorrelated and empirical autocorrelated error fields) did not showed statistical significant difference, the input elevation error pattern has not been normally distributed and therefore the random error generator realization is not suitable interpretation of true state of elevation errors. The normal distribution was rejected because of the high kurtosis and extreme values (outliners).},

Statistical approaches included: Bartlett's test of sphericity; Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix, Lawley's test of the second @l; bootstrapped confidence limits on successive @l (i.e., significant differences between @ls); and bootstrapped confidence limits on eigenvector coefficients (i.e., coefficients that differ significantly from zero). All methods were compared using simulated data matrices of uniform correlation structure, patterned matrices of varying correlation structure and data sets of lake morphometry, water chemistry, and benthic invertebrate abundance. The most consistent results were obtained from the broken-stick model and a combined measure using bootstrapped @ls and associated eigenvector coefficients. The traditional and bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman approaches over-estimated the number of nontrivial dimensions as did the fixed-amount-of-variance model. The scree plot consistently estimated one dimension more than the number of simulated dimensions. Barlett's test of sphericity showed inconsistent results. Both Bartlett's test of homogeneity of the correlation matrix and Lawley's test are limited to testing for only one and two dimensions, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple food chain might be modelled by a train of sub-models, say A, B, C, D?, the output of one sub-model serving as input of the next. The whole food-chain model yields an output y. Each sub-model has to be specified by a set of parameters, which are imperfectly known; it may also be influenced by unpredictable exogenous input. These uncertain inputs are collectively represented by the upward arrows in the diagram. The uncertainty about these inputs is often modelled by considering them as random variables. The random effects propagate through the chain, by which some accumulation will occur. Uncertainty analysis provides methods to study the consequences of these random effects. The goal of such analyses is to evaluate if the joint effect on the final output y is still acceptably small, and to pinpoint the sources that contribute most to the uncertainty about the final output y. The results may be used to assess the potential benefits of control measures and of more accurate estimation of model parameters. At present, most uncertainty analyses are performed computer-experimentally, by Monte Carlo methods. The model output is calculated for a representative sample of the uncertain model inputs. If the sample is large, the computational burden may be considerable. Several statistical methods have been developed to produce efficient Monte Carlo samples in order to keep the computational efforts as small as possible and to efficiently analyse the results. For a survey, see e.g. Helton (1993). In Section 1, uncertainty and uncertainty contributions are characterised in terms of variances and variance components. Section 2 treats standard analyses based on regression-type approximations of the model output, the uncertain inputs serving as regressors. The analysis, which yields uncertainty contributions per individual input, is valid if the regression-approximation is of good quality. The approximation may fail because of non-linearities, especially in combination with a large number of inputs. Moreover, one may be interested in contributions of groups of inputs rather than individual inputs. Section 3 describes how, in such cases, one can have recourse to methods that are not based on regression-approximations, but that are more computer-intensive. Sections 2 and 3 contain examples of uncertainty analyses of models at the beginning of the food-chain. The paper ends with a discussion section.},

Here, we show, through meta-analysis techniques, that these experiments collectively exhibited a 5.6% increase in soil C over 2?9 years, at a median rate of 19 g C m2 yr1 . We also measured C accrual in deciduous forest and grassland soils, at rates exceeding 40 g C m2 yr1 for 5?8 years, because both systems responded to CO 2 enrichment with large increases in root production. Even though native C stocks were relatively large, over half of the accrued C at both sites was incorporated into microaggregates, which protect C and increase its longevity. Our data, in combination with the meta-analysis, demonstrate the potential for mineral soils in diverse temperate ecosystems to store additional C in response to CO 2 enrichment.},

To achieve this, current erosion models are being evaluated in a series of GCTE meetings. This paper presents a synthesis of results from the first two meetings, which focused upon models for soil erosion by water at field and catchment scales, respectively. Apart from this comparison, discussions were held on model use and quality. The main conclusions from these discussions are included here as well. For both sets of evaluations, common datasets which had been split into a ?training set' and a ?testing set' were prepared and distributed to the participating modellers. For the ?testing set' data, measured values for runoff and sediment yield (field-scale models) or for erosion only (catchment-scale models) were withheld from the modellers. The data used for the field-scale evaluation represented 73 site-years from seven sites in three countries: six field-scale erosion models took part in the evaluation. For the catchment-scale evaluation, data for 10 events on a 40 ha catchment in the Netherlands was used to evaluate seven catchment models. Conclusions from both field-scale and catchment-scale exercises include the following: ? calibration is desirable for many models, and necessary for some. Calibration is most effective if the event(s) to be estimated lie inside the range of calibration events; ? total discharge is generally better predicted than peak discharge and both are better predicted than sediment discharge; ? for continuous-simulation models, long-term average results are better simulated than results for individual time periods. In general, results are less good for shorter time periods, although there are exceptions; ? while for certain events models may not perform well (absolute results), correlation coefficients between observed and predicted values are acceptable (relative results); ? at a catchment scale, the predicted spatial runoff pattern is as important as a correct prediction of the net output; ? from the discussions it was clear that additional ?soft' information, in particular regarding the change in soil structure as a result of agricultural activities and/or climate, greatly improves the quality of input data and model results},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic carbon is a soil property of central importance for soil quality and the global carbon cycle. Studies specifically aimed at the relationship between the spatial variation of soil organic carbon and environmental factors are few. In this paper, a typical small watershed named Tongshuang in the black soil region of northeast China, which was subjected to drastic erosion before 1980 and was managed subtly after 1980, was chosen as a study area. Classical statistic and geostatistic analysis methods, in combination with a geographic information system (GIS), were used to quantitatively research the spatial variation characteristics of the soil organic carbon and their relation to the topographic factors and land use. The data on the soil organic carbon, topographic factors, and land use were obtained by soil sampling and measurements derived from DEM, remote sensing images, and field investigations, respectively. The classical statistics analysis results indi- cated that the variability of the soil organic carbon was moderate (Cv = 0.30). The slope position and land use types were the most discriminating factors. The soil organic carbon content was the highest in the grassland andlowest in the coniferous forest (P < 0.01). It increased gradually along the slope position gradients from the interfluve to the toe slope. The geostatistics analysis showed that the soil organic carbon had a strong spatial correlation. The C0/(C0 + C) was 0.1608, which was mainly induced by structural factors. The mean soil organic content is 2.27% in this watershed. It is on a very low level in the northern black soil of northeast China. In this small watershed of the eroded black soil region, the present soil and water conservation measures play an important role in controlling the soil loss. However, the soil organic carbon?s restoration is unsatisfactory. Nearly three-quarters of the land has worrisome productivity. How to improve the soil organic carbon content while targeting the soil fertility is a pressing need.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the great difficulties in soil classification is that soils rarely exist as discrete individuals with clear boundaries. Instead, they grade to other soils across broad transition belts and their boundaries are determined by definition. Two new concepts, the pedon and the soil individual, have been proposed to help clarify relations between the soil continuum and soil taxonomic classes. Pedons are real, natural soil volumes just large enough to show all the soil horizons present and their relationships. Boundaries of pedons do not depend on reference to any taxonomic scheme. A soil individual (polypedon) is also a real soil body; it is a parcel of contiguous pedons all of which have characteristics lying within the defined limits of a single soil series. Pedons may be considered as building blocks that make up both soil taxonomic classes and soil mapping units. Most pedons are too small to exhibit all the characteristics of a soil individual; for example, usually they do not show shape of the soil nor nature of its boundaries with other soils. Soil individuals (polypedons) are the subject of soil taxonomy; they are the real objects that are classified. They are comparable to individual pine trees, individual fish, and individual men.},

Along with the use of principal component regression there appears to have been a growth in the misconception that the principal components with small eigenvalues will very rarely be of any use in regression. The purpose of this note is to demonstrate that these components can be as important as those with large variance. This is illustrated with four examples, three of which have already appeared in the literature.},

We studied the microporous properties of five organic soil materials and two agricultural topsoils and their size separates. The methods used were gas adsorption with N2, CO2, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2, as well as retention of the polar liquid EGME (ethylene-glycol-dimethyl-ether). Measured surface areas and micropore volumes determined with gas adsorption were strongly dependent on the molecular dimensions of the adsorbent, revealing that dried organic and mineral soil materials behave like rigid structures in the micropore range. A precipitated humic acid behaved differently, revealing a more open and/or homogeneous micropore structure. The EGME-derived surface areas of organic soil materials had a magnitude | similar to the CO2-derived surface areas. The microporous structure of the more rigid soil organic matter (SOM) materials does not seem to be affected strongly by EGME penetration. The SOM rigidity seems to be positively correlated to SOM polarity and negatively correlated to sorption coefficients of naphthalene under wet conditions. The surface areas of mineral soils and size-separates measured with CO2 and EGME were of comparable size in the absence of swelling clay minerals.},

  Abstract                 = {Although freshly formed or unaltered biogenic aggregates are easily recognized, identifying the origin of aggregates altered by physical and biological processes remains empirical and prone to error. The aim of this study was to distinguish between biogenic (BIO) and physicogenic (PHYS) aggregates in various states of fragmentation or size classes using visual, physical and chemical characteristics. Casts produced by Amynthas khami (BIO) and surrounding soil aggregates without visible biological activity (PHYS) were left to disaggregate by natural rainfall events and then separated into five size classes of >10, 10–5, 5–2, 2–0.5 and <0.5 mm. We then analysed aggregate morphology, elemental and stable isotope composition and soil stability, and used near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to determine their chemical characteristics. Although visual assessment is the method most commonly used in the field to distinguish between BIO and PHYS, our study found that the results obtained were always prone to error and that the classification was arbitrary for BIO and PHYS aggregates smaller than 5 and 2 mm in size, respectively. Soil structural stability was only useful for identifying BIO aggregates larger than 2 mm. While C content and δ13C in BIO were always different from PHYS, regardless of soil aggregate size, N content and δ15N were similar. NIRS was the most effective method because it clearly discriminated soil aggregates on the basis of size and origin. The NIRS characteristics of BIO were also more uniform than those of PHYS, suggesting that BIO aggregates have a simpler organization and as a consequence more homogeneous ecological functions. Thus, our findings suggest that information may be lost when only the physical aspect of aggregates is used to quantify the activity of ecosystem engineers in soil. After fragmentation, BIO aggregates become hidden and although it may be impossible to distinguish them visually from PHYS aggregates they retain some of their specific chemical characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {The potential of Landsat data processing to provide systematic continental scale products has been demonstrated by several projects including the \{NASA\} Web-enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project. The recent free availability of Landsat data increases the need for robust and efficient atmospheric correction algorithms applicable to large volume Landsat data sets. This paper compares the accuracy of two Landsat atmospheric correction methods: a MODIS-based method and the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) method. Both methods are based on the 6SV radiative transfer code but have different atmospheric characterization approaches. The MODIS-based method uses the \{MODIS\} Terra derived dynamic aerosol type, aerosol optical thickness, and water vapor to atmospherically correct ETM+ acquisitions in each coincident orbit. The \{LEDAPS\} method uses aerosol characterizations derived independently from each Landsat acquisition and assumes a fixed continental aerosol type and uses ancillary water vapor. Validation results are presented comparing ETM+ atmospherically corrected data generated using these two methods with \{AERONET\} corrected ETM+ data for 95 10&#xa0;km&#xa0;×&#xa0;10&#xa0;km 30&#xa0;m subsets, a total of nearly 8 million 30&#xa0;m pixels, located across the conterminous United States. The results indicate that the MODIS-based method has better accuracy than the \{LEDAPS\} method for the ETM+ red and longer wavelength bands. },

  Abstract                 = {The Pantanal, a large and still rather pristine wetland in the center of the South American continent, is becoming increasingly threatened by large development programs. Agroindustries and reservoirs for hydroelectric power generation in the catchment area modify discharge pattern and sediment load of the tributaries, plans for canalization of the Paraguay River (hidrovia) are putting in risk the natural ?ood regime of large areas inside the Pantanal, and attract industries with high potential for environmental pollution, economic pressure on the traditional cattle ranchers accelerates the transformation of natural vegetation into pasture, etc. These activities negatively affect habitat and species diversity and scenic beauty but also the hydrological buffer capacity of the Pantanal. The article summarizes the ecological conditions of the Pantanal, discusses commercial and non-commercial values of the area, describes constraints for the development of intensive agriculture and cattle ranching, and discusses development alternatives. Considering the low density of human population inside the Pantanal, it can be concluded that development pressure on the Pantanal arises mostly from pressure groups outside the area that will also mostly bene?t from the economic return of the development projects. Low density of human population would still allow the application of economically viable and environmentally friendly development alternatives that maintain and sustainably manage one of the largest wetlands in the world.},

With the method of replacing space with time, the typical restoration ecosystems of herb (dominated by Deyeuxia scabrescens, P1), shrub (dominated by Salix paraqplesia, P2), broadleaf (dominated by Betula platyphylla, P3), mixed forest (dominated by Betula spp. and Abies faxoniana, P4), and climax (dominated by Abies faxoniana, P5) were selected to quantify the carbon stock and allocation in the subalpine coniferous forest in Western Sichuan (SCFS). The results indicated that the soil organism carbon (SOC) stock decreased with the depth of soil layer, and the SOC per layer and the total SOC increased largely with the vegetation restoration. The contribution of SOC to the carbon stock of ecosystems decreased with the vegetation restoration from 89.45% to 27.06%, while the quantity was from 94.00 to 223.00 t C hm2. The carbon stock in ground cover increased with the vegetation restoration, and its contribution to the carbon stock of ecosystems was similar (3?4% of the total). Following the vegetation restoration, the plant carbon stock multiplied and reached to 430.86 ± 49.49 t C hm2 at the climax phase. During the restoration, the carbon stock of different layers increased, and the contribution of belowground to the carbon stock of ecosystems decreased sharply.

  Abstract                 = {Este estudo objetivou avaliar a deposição de nutrientes através da serapilheira produzida em um fragmento de floresta estacional decidual no município de Santa Maria, RS. Para o experimento, foram instaladas parcelas de 18 m x 20 m em seis áreas com características ambientais semelhantes, onde, em cada uma delas, foram alocados cinco coletores circulares, de 50 cm de diâmetro. As coletas de serapilheira foram realizadas mensalmente, durante um ano. A produção total de serapilheira foi de 9172 kg ha-1 (folhas 67,8%, galhos finos 19,3% e miscelânea 12,9%). O teor médio anual dos elementos na serapilheira foi de: 20,4 g kg-1 de N, 1,3 g kg-1 de P, 11,8 g kg-1 de K, 20,2 g kg-1 de Ca e 3,2 g kg-1 de Mg. Na fração folhas foram obtidos os maiores teores de K, Ca e Mg. Para o N e P, os maiores teores foram encontrados na fração miscelânea. O teor de elementos na serapilheira apresentou variações significativas durante o ano, demonstrando que a serapilheira influencia o fornecimento de nutrientes ao solo de forma sazonal, em função de sua qualidade e de sua quantidade. Através da serapilheira foram devolvidos ao solo, em kg ha-1, 196 de N, 11 de P, 114 de K, 201 de Ca e 32 de Mg, demonstrando o grande potencial da serapilheira na manutenção d.a sustentabilidade da floresta.},

  Abstract                 = {An analytic criterion for rotation is defined. The scientific advantage of analytic criteria over subjective (graphical) rotational procedures is dis- cussed. Carroll's criterion and the quartimax criterion are briefly reviewed; the varimax criterion is outlined in detail and contrasted both logically and numerically with the quartimax criterion. It is shown that the normal varimax solution probably coincides closely to the application of the principle of simple structure. However, it is proposed that the ultimate criterion of a rotational procedure is factorial invariance, not simple structure-although the two notions appear to be highly related. The normal varimax criterion is shown to be a two-dimensional generalization of the classic Spearman case, i.e., it shows perfect factorial invariance for two pure clusters. An example is given of the invariance of a normal varimax solution for more than two factors. The oblique normal varimax criterion is stated. A computational out- line for the orthogonal normal varimax is appended.},

  Abstract                 = {The organic carbon content of soil is positively related to the specific surface area (SSA), but large amounts of organic matter in soil result in reduced SSA as determined by applying the Brunauer?Emmett?Teller (BET) equation to the adsorption of N2. To elucidate some of the controlling mechanisms of this relation, we determined the SSA and the enthalpy of N2 adsorption of separates with a density > 1.6 g cm?3 from 196 mineral horizons of forest soils before and after removal of organic matter with NaOCl. Likewise, we investigated these characteristics before and after sorption of increasing amounts of organic matter to four mineral soil samples, oxides (amorphous Al(OH)3, gibbsite, ferrihydrite, goethite, haematite), and phyllosilicates (kaolinite, illite). Sorption of organic matter reduced the SSA, depending on the amount sorbed and the type of mineral. The reduction in SSA decreased at larger organic matter loadings. The SSA of the mineral soils was positively related to the content of Fe oxyhydroxides and negatively related to the content of organic C. The strong reduction in SSA at small loadings was due primarily to the decrease in the micropores to which N2 was accessible. This suggests preferential sorption of organic matter at reactive sites in or at the mouths of micropores during the initial sorption and attachment to less reactive sites at increasing loadings. The exponential decrease of the heat of gas adsorption with the surface loading points also to a filling or clogging of micropores at early stages of organic matter accumulation. Desorption induced a small recovery of the total SSA but not of the micropore surface area. Destruction of organic matter increased the SSA of all soil samples. The SSA of the uncovered mineral matrix related strongly to the amounts of Fe oxyhydroxides and the clay. Normalized to C removed, the increase in SSA was small in topsoils and illuvial horizons of Podzols rich in C and large for the subsoils containing little C. This suggests that micropores preferentially associate with organic matter, especially at small loadings. The coverage of the surface of the soil mineral matrix as calculated from the SSA before and after destruction of organic matter was correlated only with depth, and the relation appeared to be linear. We conclude that mineralogy is the primary control of the relation between surface area and sorption of organic matter within same soil compartments (i.e. horizons). But at the scale of complete profiles, the surface accumulation and stabilization of organic matter is additionally determined by its input.},

The interpolation techniques: ordinary kriging, kriging combined with regression (two models) and heterotopic co-kriging were applied to data from 153 observation points. The two models of kriging combined with regression involve: (a) linear regression of the two soil variables with the distance-to-river variable on the 153 observation points followed by kriging and (b) summation of the kriged regression values and kriged regression residuals. For co-kriging 350 additional observations for the distance-to-river-variable were employed. The distance-to-river data were easily obtained from the map of the area which was stored in a Geographical Information System (GIS). The performances of the methods were evaluated and compared using the cross-validation method. The mean error of prediction indicates reasonably small bias of prediction for the two soil variables by almost all the methods. The mean square error showed that heterotopic co-kriging produced better estimates of the soil variables than kriging but there was a clear advantage in using the first model of kriging combined with linear regression technique. The second model of kriging combined with regression does not show any particular advantage over the other methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), Non-Annex 1 countries such as Kenya are obliged to report green house gas (GHG) emissions from all sources where possible, including those from soils as a result of changes in land use or land management. At present, the convention encourages countries to estimate emissions using the most advanced methods possible, given the country circumstances and resources. Estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and changes were made for Kenya using the Global Environment Facility Soil Organic Carbon (GEFSOC) Modelling System. The tool conducts analysis using three methods: (1) the Century general ecosystem model; (2) the RothC soil C decomposition model; and (3) the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method for assessing soil C at regional scales. The required datasets included: land use history, monthly mean precipitation, monthly mean minimum and maximum temperatures for all the agro-climatic zones of Kenya and historical vegetation cover. Soil C stocks of 1.4?2.0 Pg (0?20 cm), compared well with a Soil and Terrain (SOTER) based approach that estimated 1.8?2.0 Pg (0?30 cm). In 1990 48% of the country had SOC stocks of <18 t C ha1 and 20% of the country had SOC stocks of 18?30 t C ha1, whereas in 2000 56% of the country had SOC stocks of <18 t C ha1 and 31% of the country had SOC stocks of 18?30 t C ha1. Conversion of natural vegetation to annual crops led to the greatest soil C losses. Simulations suggest that soil C losses remain substantial throughout the modelling period of 1990?2030. All three methods involved in the GEFSOC System estimated that there would be a net loss of soil C between 2000 and 2030 in Kenya. The decline was more marked with RothC than with Century or the IPCC method. In non-hydric soils the SOC change rates were more pronounced in high sandy soils compared to high clay soils in most land use systems.},

Educational and assessment approaches, ranging from simple scorecard and test-kit monitoring to comprehensive quantitative assessments and indexing using soils databases, have been pursued. The programs have emphasized that soil quality is not “an end in itself” but rather a tool for evaluating and understanding the effects of soil management on a specific soil resource. The approaches have stressed that to determine how well a soil is functioning, inherent and dynamic soil properties and processes must be evaluated using biological, chemical, and physical indicators. No soil quality researcher has ever envisioned the concept would replace modern soil survey programs or diminish the importance of scientifically based soil management strategies. Herein, we present the scientific merits of soil quality research.},

Salient among these issues are ambiguities regarding the meaning of current measures of clinical significance, the importance of relating assessment of clinical significance to the goals of therapy, and evaluation of the construct(s) that clinical significance reflects. Research directions that are discussed include developing a typology of therapy goals, evaluating cutoff scores and thresholds for clinical significance, and attending to social as well as clinical impact of treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {Geologic maps are products of complex analyses and interpretations, and as such, contain a certain amount of uncertainty. Unfortunately, it is difficult to estimate the uncertainty within a geologic map. Much of this difficulty is due to the lack of a clear framework for describing the sources of uncertainty within the map and poor awareness, within the mapping community, of methods capable of estimating these sources of uncertainty. Mann (1993) provides a discussion of uncertainty in geology and a framework for identifying the sources of uncertainty. His discussion is not limited to maps, but focuses more on data. Bardossy and Fodor (2001) use Mann?s (1993) framework and extend his ideas by proposing four groups of mathematical methods that can be applied to characterize uncertainty in geology. Their discussion provides some innovative suggestions of methods for estimating uncertainty. As with Mann?s (1993) treatment, they focus most of their discussion on data issues and do not provide any recommendations for conducting a comprehensive evaluation of uncertainty within geologic maps. I will present a framework for characterizing the sources of uncertainty in geologic maps which builds significantly on the insights provided by Mann (1993). I will extend Bardossy and Fodor?s (2001) discussion by presenting a larger suite of practical methods for characterizing the uncertainty in geologic maps due to these different sources. Finally, I will briefly discuss concerns for conducting a more comprehensive, integrated evaluation of uncertainty in geologic maps and for interpreting and applying the results from such a comprehensive uncertainty analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {The 1:50,000 national soil survey of the Netherlands, completed in the early 1990s after more than three decades of mapping, is gradually becoming outdated. Large-scale changes in land and water management that took place after the field surveys have had a great impact on the soil. Especially oxidation of peat soils has resulted in a substantial decline of these soils. The aim of this research was to update the national soil map for the province of Drenthe (2680 km2) without additional fieldwork through digital soil mapping using legacy soil data. Multinomial logistic regression was used to quantify the relationship between ancillary variables and soil group. Special attention was given to model-building as this is perhaps the most crucial step in digital soil mapping. A framework for building a logistic regression model was taken from the literature and adapted for the purpose of soil mapping. The model-building process was guided by pedological expert knowledge to ensure that the final regression model is not only statistically sound but also pedologically plausible. We built separate models for the ten major map units, representing the main soil groups, of the national soil map for the province of Drenthe. The calibrated models were used to estimate the probability of occurrence of soil groups on a 25 m grid. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of the updated soil map, and the updated soil map was validated by an independent probability sample. The theoretical purity of the updated map was 67%. The estimated actual purity of the updated map, as assessed by the validation sample, was 58%, which is 6% larger than the actual purity of the national soil map. The discrepancy between theoretical and actual purity might be explained by the spatial clustering of the soil profile observations used to calibrate the multinomial logistic regression models and by the age difference between calibration and validation observations.},

  Abstract                 = {This study compared the efficiency of geostatistical digital soil mapping (DSM) with conventional soil mapping (CSM) for updating soil class and property maps of a cultivated peatland in the Netherlands. For digital soil class mapping, the generalized linear geostatistical model was used. Digital mapping of the soil organic matter (SOM) content and peat thickness was done by universal kriging. The conventional soil class map was created by free survey, while the property maps were created with the representative profile description (RPD) and map unit means (MUM) methods. For each method, we computed the effort invested in the mapping in terms of the sampling and cost densities. The accuracies of the created soil maps were estimated from independent probability sample data. The results showed that for DSM, the cost density could be reduced by a factor of three compared with CSM without compromising accuracy. The map purity of both maps was around 55%. For conventional soil property mapping, the MUM maps were more accurate than the RPD maps. For SOM, CSM-MUM (RMSE 7.5%) performed better than DSM (RMSE 12.1%), although accuracy differences were not significant. For peat thickness, DSM (RMSE 23.3 cm) performed slightly better than CSM-MUM (RMSE 24.9 cm). Despite the differences in accuracy being small, the digital soil property maps were produced more efficiently. The cost density was a factor of 3.5 smaller. We conclude that for updating conventional soil maps in the Dutch peatlands, geostatistical DSM can be more efficient, although not necessarily more accurate, than CSM.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a review on Latosols (oxisols) genesis, classification and use in tropical Brazil. Chemical, physical and mineralogical aspects are throughly discussed, as well as their relationship with soil use and management. Some problems of definition are considered for all types of Latosols recognized in the Brazilian System of Soil Classification. The role of clay minerals such as kaolinite, gibbsite and iron oxides (namely hematite, goethite, magnetite and maghemite) is discussed against the background of soil classification and soil fertility aspects. The ammount of trace-elements and the relationship between these elements (Mn, Cu, Zn, Co) and latosols genesis and classification is shown, illustrating the trend of higher values for those soils developed from mafic rocks and alike. The geographic distribution of latosols classes in Brazil (namely Ferriferous, Dusky-Red, Dark-Red, Red-Yellow, Yellow, Brown, Humic, Una variation and Pallid) is given. Finnaly, a general view on phosphorous adsorption for the various types of latosols is presented, illustrating the importance of the clay mineralogy as a primary factor of controlling P availability in these soils.},

  Abstract                 = {To manage land in a site-specific way for agriculture requires detailed maps of the variation in the soil properties of interest. To predict accurately for mapping, the interval at which the soil is sampled should relate to the scale of spatial variation. A variogram can be used to guide sampling in two ways. A sampling interval of less than half the range of spatial dependence can be used, or the variogram can be used with the kriging equations to determine an optimal sampling interval to achieve a given tolerable error. Avariogram might not be available for the site, but if the variograms of several soil properties were available on a similar parent material and or particular topographic positions an average variogram could be calculated from these. Averages of the variogram ranges and standardized average variograms from four different parent materials in southern England were used to suggest suitable sampling intervals for future surveys in similar pedological settings based on half the variogram range. The standardized average variograms were also used to determine optimal sampling intervals using the kriging equations. Similar sampling intervals were suggested by each method and the maps of predictions based on data at different grid spacings were evaluated for the different parent materials. Variograms of loss on ignition (LOI) taken from the literature for other sites in southern England with similar parent materials had ranges close to the average for a given parent material showing the possible wider application of such averages to guide sampling.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been generally accepted that the method of moments (MoM) variogram, which has been widely applied in soil science, requires about 100 sites at an appropriate interval apart to describe the variation adequately. This sample size is often larger than can be afforded for soil surveys of agricultural fields or contaminated sites. Furthermore, it might be a much larger sample size than is needed where the scale of variation is large. A possible alternative in such situations is the residual maximum likelihood (REML) variogram because fewer data appear to be required. The REML method is parametric and is considered reliable where there is trend in the data because it is based on generalized increments that filter trend out and only the covariance parameters are estimated. Previous research has suggested that fewer data are needed to compute a reliable variogram using a maximum likelihood approach such as REML, however, the results can vary according to the nature of the spatial variation. There remain issues to examine: how many fewer data can be used, how should the sampling sites be distributed over the site of interest, and how do different degrees of spatial variation affect the data requirements? The soil of four field sites of different size, physiography, parent material and soil type was sampled intensively, and MoM and REML variograms were calculated for clay content. The data were then sub-sampled to give different sample sizes and distributions of sites and the variograms were computed again. The model parameters for the sets of variograms for each site were used for cross-validation. Predictions based on REML variograms were generally more accurate than those from MoM variograms with fewer than 100 sampling sites. A sample size of around 50 sites at an appropriate distance apart, possibly determined from variograms of ancillary data, appears adequate to compute REML variograms for kriging soil properties for precision agriculture and contaminated sites.},

Based on the degree of soil development and luminescence dating, eight soil geomorphic units have been deciphered and grouped into four members (I?IV) of a morphostratigraphic sequence for the study area. Various soil geomorphic units included in different member/sub-members are: Member I-river floodplains and active tidal flats (b500 years); Member II-distal Piedmont Plains and old tidal flats (0.5?2 ka); Member III-proximal Piedmont Plains (6?10 ka); and Member IV-Mainland Higher and Lower Hillocks and Island Hillocks (N15 ka). Member IV is further subdivided into Sub-member IVa-Island Hillocks (15?18 ka); Sub-member IVb-Mainland Lower Hillocks (23?25 ka); and Sub-member IVc-Mainland Higher Hillocks (30?35 ka). The youngest and poorly developed soils of Member I show features related to hydromorphism. Moderately developed soils of Members II and III show a fersiallitisation stage of pedogenesis. Member IV includes dstrongly developed soilsT with a ferrugination stage of pedogenesis. These soils also exhibit degradation and poor birefringence of argillans and ferriargillans, indicating a significant change in conditions of pedogenesis, probably related to a paleoclimatic change from a subhumid to semiarid phase (40 ka to about 16 ka) to a hot humid to subhumid phase (16 ka?present). Parent material composition and physiography also have affected the pedogenesis in the area. Based on ages and heights above the mean sea level for the five terraces recognized in the study area, the overall base-level rise rates calculated are about 3.6 mm/year (18 ka?present) for the Maiskhali Island and 2.86 mm/year (35 ka?present) for the mainland (Jaldi anticline). These base level changes represent combined effects of eustatic sea level and tectonic uplift due to folding.},

Pedotransfer Functions (PTFs) have proven to be useful to indirectly estimate these parameters from more easily obtainable soil data. Until now no studies have been conducted to derive or verify PTFs for calcareous soils, which hydraulically may not behave the same as non-calcareous soils. The objectives of this study were to assess the influence of soil CaCO3 on the soil water retention characteristics of some calcareous soils, and to derive PTFs for these soils. Two data sets were used to derive and evaluate the established PTFs. Data set 1 containing 220 samples was employed as a calibration set for multiple linear regression. An independent data set containing 55 soil samples from a different location served to verify the derived PTFs. No significant difference in accuracy was found between the PTFs with and without CaCO3 in terms of estimating specific soil water retention values or the van Genuchten soil hydraulic parameters. Compared with the Rosetta PTFs of Schaap et al. (2001), the derived point and parametric PTFs provided better accuracy with average RMSE values of 0.028 and 0.107 cm3cm-3, respectively.},

The Optimum Index Factor (OIF) was developed by Chavez et al. (1982, 1984) as a method for determining the three-band combination that maximizes the variability in a particular multispectral scene. The OIF is based on the amount of total variance and correlation within and between all possible band combinations in the dataset. Although the OIF method was developed for Landsat TM data, the concept and methodology are applicable to any multilayer dataset. We used the OIF method in a subset area of the initial soil survey of the Duchesne Area, Utah, USA, to help determine which combination of data layers would be most useful for modeling soil distribution. Unique multiband images created from layers of multiple data types (elevation and remote sensing derivatives) were evaluated using the OIF method to determine which data layers would maximize the biophysical variability in the study area. A multiband image was created from the optimum combinations of data layers and used for classiﬁ- cation and modeling in ERDAS Imagine. The output from the classiﬁcation and modeling are being evaluated as pre-maps for soil mapping activities in the study area.},

  Abstract                 = {Wet and saline soils have been recognized as an important and complex component of wetland ecosystems in arid environments. Analysis and classification of remotely sensed spectral data is an effective method for discerning the spatial and temporal variability of soils. The East Shore Area (ESA) of the Great Salt Lake soil survey update is focused on updating soil map units containing wet and saline soils. The ESA provides a unique environment for the use of remotely sensed spectral data for map unit refinement because of low relief and a large extent of soils that are wet and saline to various degrees. Map units in the ESA containing wet and saline soils were updated and refined using Landsat 7 imagery. Five land-cover classes are related to dominant soil types that vary in soil wetness, salinity, calcium carbonate concentration and vegetation cover type. Supervised classification of the imagery was performed using the five land cover classes. The final classification resulted in 14 land cover classes, including nine additional classes that help describe the variability in the original five classes. The classification results were validated using visual inspection in the field, a priori knowledge of the area and an error matrix. The results of the classification were used to enhance original soil map units and calculate map unit composition in the final soil mapping process. This information was then incorporated into the updated soil map. Temporal variation in land cover classes has the potential to be considered in map-unit refinement to reflect the dynamic nature of the margins of the Great Salt Lake, Utah.},

The traditional approach to tackling this bias problem is cross-validation. The bootstrap is another way to bring down the high variability of cross-validation. But a direct comparison of the two estimators, cross-validation and bootstrap, is not fair because the latter estimator requires much heavier computation. We performed an empirical study to compare the .632+ bootstrap estimator with the repeated 10-fold cross-validation and the repeated one-third holdout estimator. All the estimators were set to require about the same amount of computation. In the simulation study, the repeated 10-fold cross-validation estimator was found to have better performance than the .632+ bootstrap estimator when the classifier is highly adaptive to the training sample. We have also found that the .632+ bootstrap estimator suffers from a bias problem for large samples as well as for small samples.},

The sampling frame used for the survey designs is contained in either an ESRI shapele, a data frame, or an sp package object. The frame contains the coordinates for a set of points that dene the nite resource in addition to attribute data associated with the points. The coordinate system for the set of points in the sampling frame is an equal area projection rather than latitude and longitude. An equal area projection is used so that calculation of distance between points is valid. Use of the three sources for the sampling frame will be illustrated in the example survey designs.},

Principal components analysis can be used to select those variables that contain the most information. Using an environmental dataset consisting of 36 meteorological variables spanning 37 years, four methods of variable selection are examined along with different criteria levels for deciding on the number of variables to retain. Procrustes analysis, a measure of similarity and bivariate plots are used to assess the success of the alternative variable selection methods and criteria levels in extracting representative variables. The Broken-stick model is a consistent approach to choosing significant principal components and is chosen here as the more suitable criterion in combination with a selection method that requires one principal component analysis and retains variables by starting with selection from the first component.},

The models were validated by leave-one-out crossvalidation, leave-N-out crossvalidation (LNO), external validation, y-randomization and bootstrapping. Validations have shown that the size of the training sets is the crucial factor in determining model performance, which deteriorates as the data set becomes smaller. Models from very small data sets suffer from the impossibility of being thoroughly validated, failure and atypical behavior in certain validations (chance correlation, lack of robustness to resampling and LNO), regardless of their good performance in leave-one-out crossvalidation, fitting and even in external validation. A simple determination of the critical Nin LNO has been introduced by using the limit of 0.1 for oscillations in Q2, quantified as the variation range in single LNO and two standard deviations in multiple LNO. It has been demonstrated that it is sufficient to perform 10 -25 y-randomization and bootstrap runs for a typical model validation. The bootstrap schemes based on hierarchical cluster analysis give more reliable and reasonable results than bootstraps relying only on randomization of the complete data set. Data quality in terms of statistical significance of descriptor -yrelationships is the second important factor for model performance.Variable selection that does not eliminate insignificant descriptor - yrelationships may lead to situations in which they are not detected during model validation, especially when dealing with large data sets.},

Na categoria dos intermediários, escolheram-se trabalhos, discriminando-os em Grupo I (escala 1:100.000) e Grupo II (escala de 1:65.000 e 1:50.000). Levantamentos detalhados, com escalas de 1:10.000 a 1:4.000, da região Centro-Oeste, constituíram os trabalhos da categoria dos detalhados.

This review highlights soil organic matter studies based mainly on solid-state 13C and 15N NMR spectroscopy and some emerging applications, that may provide significant progress in our knowledge on soil organic matter. A major advantage of Nmr spectroscopy is that it can be used as a non-invasive method for solid soil samples or soil fractions. Although resolution is limited, one can obtain an overview on the organic matter structures present in the soil sample. Application of 13C and 15N NMR to soils has, for a long time, been confined to the study of bulk soils or humic extracts for structural characterization. The transformations of soil organic C and N are now being investigated after addition of 13C- and 15N-labelled parent materials to the soil and following their evolution in different C and N pools. With labelling techniques it is also possible to study the interaction of organic pollutants with soil organic matter. Contamination of a soil with man-made additives, such as soot or brown coal dust, can also be detected in soils or individual soil fractions.},

  Abstract                 = {We summarize progress with respect to (1) different approaches to isolate, extract, and quantify organo-mineral compounds fromsoils, (2) types ofmineral surfaces and associated interactions, (3) the distribution and function of soil biota at organo-mineral surfaces, (4) the distribution and content of organo-mineral associations, and (5) the factors controlling the turnover of organic matter (OM) in organo-mineral associations from temperate soils. Physical fractionation achieves a rough separation between plant residues and mineral-associated OM, which makes density or particle-size fractionation a useful pretreatment for further differentiation of functional fractions. A part of the OM in organo-mineral associations resists different chemical treatments, but the data obtained cannot readily be compared among each other, andmore research is necessary on the processes underlying resistance to treatments for certainOMcomponents. Studies using physical-fractionation procedures followed by soil-microbiological analyses revealed that organo-mineral associations spatially isolate C sources from soil biota, making quantity and quality of OM in microhabitats an important factor controlling community composition. The distribution and activity of soil microorganisms at organo-mineral surfaces can additionally be modified by faunal activities. Composition of OM in organo-mineral associations is highly variable, with loamy soils having generally a higher contribution of polysaccharides, whereas mineral-associated OM in sandy soils is often more aliphatic. Though highly reactive towards Fe oxide surfaces, lignin and phenolic components are usually depleted in organo-mineral associations. Charred OM associated with the mineral surface contributes to a higher aromaticity in heavy fractions. The relative proportion of OC bound in organomineral fractions increaseswith soil depth. Likewise does the strength of the bonding.Organicmolecules sorbed to the mineral surfaces or precipitated by Al are effectively stabilized, indicated by reduced susceptibility towards oxidative attack, higher thermal stability, and lower bioavailability. At higher surface loading, organic C is much better bioavailable, also indicated by little 14C age. In the subsurface horizons of the soils investigated in this study, Fe oxides seem to be the most important sorbents, whereas phyllosilicate surfaces may be comparatively more important in topsoils. Specific surface area of soilminerals is not always a good predictor forC-stabilization potentials because surface coverage is discontinuous. Recalcitrance and accessibility/aggregation seemto determine the turnover dynamics in fast and intermediate cycling OM pools, but for long-termOC preservation the interactions with mineral surfaces, and especially with Fe oxide surfaces, are a major control in all soils investigated here.},

We report on a largescale experiment-over half a million runs of C4.5 and a Naive-Bayes algorithm-to estimate the effects of different parameters on these algrithms on real-world datasets. For crossvalidation we vary the number of folds and whether the folds are stratified or not, for bootstrap, we vary the number of bootstrap samples.

For a given set of inventory data the reported change of carbon stock varied between 3.1 tonnes C ha1 yr1and 34.4 tonnes C ha1 yr1 for a 10-year period. Based on the available data set from a test area in the federal state of Salzburg (Austria) the effect of different scenarios for harvesting operations and mortality on reported carbon release was studied. The scenarios covered timber utilization at different points in time and two mortality rates (constant and exponential). A proportion of harvesting was assumed to remain inside the forest as logging residues and entered together with mortality a decay process. Two different lifetimes for decay (10 and 50 years) and constant and negative exponential decay rates were simulated. Those decisions affect the amount of carbon released considerably. For a 10-year period between 5% and 80% of the carbon content of dead woody material that accumulated within the period is released to the atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {The question of whether organization and degree of integration of ecological communities are related in a predictable manner to patterns of variability in abundance as well as to patterns of environmental variability is important for theoretical and practical reasons. However, a quantitative answer to this question is difficult as no single measure of organization and variability gained widespread acceptance. Ecological communities exhibit hierarchical structure and that structure can be interpreted as an index of integration and organization. Constituents of such communities show patterns of variability amenable to power spectrum analysis (often abbreviated as 1/f?, where ? is the power exponent characterizing contribution of events of different magnitudes to the overall pattern of variability). I postulated that richer, and thus more hierarchical communities, should gravitate further away from white noise (random) than simple communities. Also, I postulated that communities in more stable physical habitats will also show pattern of variability indicative of complex, multiscale organization. In this paper I analyze the data from natural microcosms to test the above hypotheses. The data span a time series of abundance data for over 70 species of invertebrates occupying 49 supratidal rock pools in Jamaica. These rock pools have many attributes of general ecological systems. The analyses led to a number of findings. First, I established that richer communities have some attributes of higher integration by finding that they are more resistant to periodic ?invasions? (return of species previously present). Second, variability of the physical environmental variables, whether at small or large scales, was within the typical range observed in other studies, with power spectrum exponents close to 1. Third, the variability of component populations differed consistently with theoretical expectations. Specifically, physically more stable pools contained communities whose power spectrum exponent was higher than those in physically variable pools. The same was true for species-rich as compared to species-poor pools. These observations mean that variability is more episodic in pool communities with higher organization and lesser external perturbation levels, with overall variability declining. Fourth, variability of biotic components was substantially different from variability of the environmental variables, suggesting that the physical environment may be a constraining but not necessarily the driving force. I further suggest that different exponents should characterize communities at different stages of development and self-organization.},

  Abstract                 = {Tree survival, growth, and foliar nutrition were evaluated in two studies on coal minesoils in southeastern Ohio. A topsoiling-fertilizing study contrasted three constructed soil profiles (graded cast overburden, graded cast overburden under 30 cm of standard graded or ripped topsoil) and six phosphorus fertilizer treatments (0, 280, or 560 kgha-? triple superphosphate. and 0, 1120, or 2240 kgha- ? rock phosphate). A ripping-fertilizing study used only graded cast overburden, ripped to 1.2 m depth or not ripped, and four fertilizer treatments (0 kgha-? P and N, and 112 kgha- ? P in combination with 0, 168, or 336 kgha- ? N). Fertilizer treatments were in addition to fertilizers applied during ground cover seeding. After 7 years, overall tree survival was excellent for green ash (Fraxinus pennsyluanica Marsh.) (9 1% survival) but poor for silver maple ( Acer saccharinurn L.) (15-2 I%), sycamore (Platunus occident&s L.) (9%) and white pine (Pinus strobus L.) (1%). Austrian pine (Pinus nigra Arnold) survived moderately well in the topsoiling study (62%) but failed in the soil ripping study (0%). Deer browsing and rabbit cutting contributed to poor tree survival. In the topsoiling study, green ash was taller on both topsoil profiles (total height, 85 cm) than on cast overburden (64 cm). Austrian pine was also taller on standard topsoil (I 15 cm) and ripped topsoil (102 cm) than on cast overburden (68 cm). Tree performance was not improved by ripping topsoil in the topsoiling study or by ripping cast overburden in the soil ripping study. For comparable fertilizer treatments, green ash grew better on cast overburden (ripped or not ripped) in the ripping study than on topsoils in the topsoiling study. Silver maple survived better (29% vs. 11%) and green ash was taller (126 cm vs. 101 cm) on plots that received both N and P than on plots that received no fertilizer. Fertilization with P alone was not effective. Foliar N concentrations in green ash (12.4-13.6 gkg-? in the topsoiling study; 15.0-16.4 gkg - ? in soil ripping study) and Austrian pine (6.7-7.0 gkgg ? in topsoiling study) were much less than optimal. Of treatments tested, provision of adequate N by fertilizers appears to have the most potential for improving tree growth on these minesoils, but controlling animal damage would probably have a greater impact on survival and early growth than any fertilizer treatment.},

Este trabalho tem como objetivo a aplicação da geoestatística na espacialização dos atributos do solo e a delimitação das unidades de mapeamento através da técnica booleana. A área de estudo se localiza no Centro de Estações Experimentais do Cangüiri ? Universidade Federal do Paraná, situado nas coordenadas N= 7190000 m e E= 688000 m no sistema de projeção UTM. Foram utilizados 135 perfis coletados em tubos de PVC de 100mm, através de um trado mecânico acoplado na tomada de força de um trator. Os pontos amostrados correspondem a uma sistema de malha, com espaçamento de 30 m x 30 m, tendo ainda 12 pontos amostrados em espaçamento variando entre 1 m e 15 m. Foram realizadas análises granulométrica e química dos elementos cálcio, magnésio, potássio, alumínio, hidrogênio, fósforo, carbono, pH em água e pH em KCL dos horizontes A e B. Os dados obtidos foram transferidos para vetores de pontos. A krigagem dos atributos do solo resultou em imagens contínuas de representação das variações de cada atributo. Através da análise booleana, se utilizou os parâmetros e critérios de classificação de solos estabelecidos pelo Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos (EMBRAPA, 1999), para a espacialização das classes de solos. Estas foram submetidas aos critérios cartográficos de representação, onde foram obtidos os limites das unidades de mapeamento simples e associações. Os resultados geoestatísticos trabalhados em conjunto na rotina booleana mostraram ser capazes de classificar e delinear unidades de mapeamento de solos. Este resultado mostra ser possível informatizar o processo de classificação de solos, proporcionando mais velocidade e menos subjetividade no delineamento das unidades de mapeamento.},

  Abstract                 = {The cosmos it seems is a vast unending system of phenomenal energy and the Earth is a unique subsystem of the cosmos not known to be duplicated. The numerous subsystems of the Earth contribute to this variability, and life, as we perceive it, comprises a myriad of subsystems the evolution of which has given rise to humans whose systems and subsystems constantly amaze us. In simplistic terms life on terrestrial portions of Earth requires air, water, shelter and sources of energy in order to survive. Survival depends on an ability to classify variability, to envision and interpret relationships among domains and objects within domains, and to respond to known or perceived consequences of those relationships. Thus we are innately conditioned and trained to classify, correlate, interpret and store or discard information about variability. As humans we are exposed to variability, either without choice or through our curiosity, and this causes us to classify these massive sources of information into manageable segments for our existing mental capacities. We mentally put objects, visual clues, sounds and so forth into generalized groups or domains for which we develop archetypes that enable us to quickly distinguish and segregate different populations. The objects in these domains can then be separated into smaller clusters with which we associate specific properties (either imagined or measured). This is the process of correlation that enables us to establish relationships among and between members of populations. For many classifications and correlations of object variability our mental processes seem to be unconscious rather than deliberate activities. Common interpretations of relationships refer to whether we believe they are cause-and-effect, maybe cause-and-effect or unknown (empirical). We tend to prefer the cause-and-effect ones because they provide us with possible explanations of what is happening in the milieu of variability that surrounds us. Do we save the information about our interpretations or discard it? As can be seen, this is another classification issue. If we have a spoken language we save them as stories to pass on to others; if we have a written language we write down the details of the stories. If, as individuals, we choose to discard our interpretations of relationships they go into our huge areas of ignorance.},

  Abstract                 = {Whole soil profile assessments of soil C stocks are enormously important for evaluating a soil's potential for sequestering C. Carbon stock measurements are often highly variable, which makes the detection of statistically significant differences among different land uses and management systems difficult. A common mistake is to interpret a lack of statistical significance as evidence for the absence of differences. This mistake is costly: failure to identify practices and habitats that accumulate C can affect our understanding of soil C cycling and hide possible sequestration potentials. In this study, we investigated inadequate replication as a major cause of a lack of statistical significance. Power analysis is a well-established statistical tool that allows researchers to infer whether the lack of statistical significance is due to the absence of meaningful differences or due to insufficient replication. We used data from two published studies to illustrate the value of power analysis. In particular, we showed that in these studies the chances of detecting even substantial (e.g., 50%) differences among experimental treatments can be as low as 20 to 60% due to the natural variability in soil C concentrations and stocks. Carbon variability in different soil horizons suggests that statistical analyses of soil C stocks should be conducted separately for each sampled horizon and that conclusions about the profile as a whole should be made based on the individual horizon results. Devising an optimal sampling strategy that identifies the appropriate number of replicates needed to detect significant C change by horizon is essential.},

Apart from the spatial challenges that often have to be faced in map integration the semantics of datasets have to be well understood for successful data integration. So-called #ontology-based# approaches for the semantic integration of multi-source geographical datasets may be used to give a firm conceptual basis to digital soil mapping from multi-scale, multi-source geographic data. This chapter explores the use of ontologies in semantic data integration. A first version of an approach for ontology-based data integration for soil-landscape mapping is presented consisting of semantic factoring, ontology definition, reference model construction and data integration. This approach is illustrated with the semantic integration of a small-scale (1:400,000) soil-geomorphic map with a geological map at 1:50,000 scale of the Antequera area in Spain. Comparison of the results of our approach to semantic integration with an Antequera geo-pedological legend designed to map soil-landforms in this area at 1:50,000 scale shows a clear correspondence of ontologies.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil erosion in Indonesia has occurred at an alarming rate. A management challenge arises not only because of the lack of understanding of soil erosion processes and lack of data, but also due to difficulties in the application of soil erosion models. The objectives here are to measure erosion rates and sediment yields in a watershed in West Java using the Agricultural Non-point Source Pollution (AGNPS) model, to document rates of erosion from forestry and agroforestry land uses in the basin, and to compare soil erosion rates calculated by the AGNPS and Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) models. The method was to use both primary and secondary data as inputs to the AGNPS and USLE models, as well as field observations to compare the outputs from the two models with conditions in the field. The AGNPS model measured about half of the erosion rate predicted by the USLE. However, the AGNPS output appears to be more realistic. The erosion rates of the study area (2592 ha; 6.402 acres) were 95 and 103 ton/ha/yr (8,480 and 9,205 ton/acre/yr) in 1991 and 1992. The sediment yields were 99,630 ha/year (246,000 ton/yr) in 1991, and 108,135 ha (267,000 ton/yr) in 1992. The t-test regarding soil erosion in forested and agroforestry areas demonstrates that the difference in soil erosion rates is not statistically significant (? =0.05). Based on this finding, agroforestry is an excellent choice of land use to minimize soil erosion rates.},

In solutions at pH 4, where Fe was introduced as dissolved Fe(III), both H2O2 and 14C-labeled formic acid decomposed at measurable rates that agreed reasonably well with those predicted by a kinetic model of the chain reaction mechanism, using published rate constants extrapolated to pH 4. The ratio of the formic acid and H2O2 decomposition rates, as well as the dramatic effect of tert-butyl alcohol on these rates, confirmed that a solution chain reaction mechanism involving ¥OH controlled the decomposition kinetics of both compounds. In the presence of ferrihydrite as the iron source, the ratio of the rate of formic acid decomposition to that of H2O2 decomposition was significantly lower than that observed in the presence of only dissolved Fe. Moreover, neither rate diminished drastically upon addition of tert-butyl alcohol, indicating that the solution phase chain reaction is not a dominant decomposition pathway of H2O2 and formic acid. Relative decomposition rates of formic acid and a second ¥OH probe, benzoic acid, were consistent with oxidation of these compounds by ¥OH. These observations can be reproduced by a kinetic model including (a) decomposition of H2O2 at the iron oxide surface, producing ¥OH with lower yield than the reaction sequence with dissolved Fe, and (b) low concentrations of dissolved Fe in the presence of ferrihydrite, preventing propagation of the solution phase chain reaction.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial information in the form of geographical information system coverages and remotely sensed imagery is increasingly used in ecological modeling. Examples include maps of land cover type from which ecologically relevant properties, such as biomass or leaf area index, are derived. Spatial information, however, is not error-free: acquisition and processing errors, as well as the complexity of the physical processes involved, make remotely sensed data imperfect measurements of ecological attributes. It is therefore important to first assess the accuracy of the spatial information being used and then evaluate the impact of such inaccurate information on ecological model predictions. In this paper, the role of geostatistics for mapping thematic classification accuracy through integration of abundant image-derived (soft) and sparse higher accuracy (hard) class labels is presented. Such assessment leads to local indices of map quality, which can be used for guiding additional ground surveys. Stochastic simulation is proposed for generating multiple alternative realizations (maps) of the spatial distribution of the higher accuracy class labels over the study area. All simulated realizations are consistent with the available pieces of information (hard and soft labels) up to their validated level of accuracy. The simulated alternative class label representations can be used for assessing joint spatial accuracy, i.e., classification accuracy regarding entire spatial features read from the thematic map. Such realizations can also serve as input parameters to spatially explicit ecological models; the resulting distribution of ecological responses provides a model of uncertainty regarding the ecological model prediction. A case study illustrates the generation of alternative land cover maps for a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) subscene, and the subsequent construction of local map quality indices. Simulated land cover maps are then input into a biogeochemical model for assessing uncertainty regarding net primary production (NPP).},

  Abstract                 = { A geostatistical methodology is proposed for integrating elevation estimates derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and elevation measurements of higher accuracy, e.g., elevation spot heights. The sparse elevation measurements (hard data) and the abundant DEM-reported elevations (soft data) are employed for modeling the unknown higher accuracy (reference) elevation surface in a way that properly reflects the relative reliability of the two sources of information. Stochastic conditional simulation is performed for generating alternative, equiprobable images (numerical models) of the unknown reference elevation surface using both hard and soft data. These numerical models reproduce the hard elevation data at their measurement locations, and a set of auto and crosscovariance models quantifying spatial correlation between data of the two sources of information at various spatial scales. From this set of alternative representations of the reference elevation, the probability that the unknown reference value is greater than that reported at each node in the DEM is determined. Joint uncertainty associated with spatial features observed in the DEM, e.g. the probability for an entire ridge existing, is also modeled from this set of alternative images. A case study illustrating the proposed conflation procedure is presented for a portion of a USGS one-degree DEM. It is suggested that maps of local probabilities for over or underestimation of the unknown reference elevation values from those reported in the DEM, and joint probability values attached to different spatial features, be provided to DEM users in addition to traditionally reported summary statistics used to quantify DEM accuracy. Such a metadata element would be a valuable tool for subsequent decision-making processes that are based on the DEM elevation surface, or for targeting areas where more accurate elevation measurements are required. },

  Abstract                 = {O entendimento das relações entre geologia, geomorfologia e pedologia auxilia nas atividades de classificação dos solos e na avaliação da distribuição pedológica de uma área. Este trabalho foi motivado pela escassez de estudos dessa natureza na região de Lavras (MG), onde ocorrem várias classes de solos, relacionados com a grande variedade petrológica do material de origem e com a ocorrência de domínios geomorfológicos distintos. O objetivo deste trabalho foi estudar as relações entre material de origem (relação pedogeológica), classes de relevo (relação pedogeomorfológica) e solos com horizontes B textural e B nítico, visando propor um modelo da distribuição desses solos na paisagem de Lavras. Os solos com horizontes B textural e B nítico de ocorrência regional foram selecionados de acordo com o estádio de evolução, que permite preservar características das rochas parentais. Esses solos são desenvolvidos nessa região em relevos ondulados a forte ondulados, originando diferentes classes de solos com horizontes B textural e B nítico relacionados ao material de origem. Para desenvolvimento deste estudo, foram realizadas a interpretação petrológica do substrato rochoso e a individualização do relevo, por meio de classes de declividade. Mediante campanhas de campo, foram selecionados e caracterizados perfis representativos das principais classes dos solos em estudo e foram avaliadas as relações pedogeológicas associadas às relações pedogeomorfológicas, permitindo a proposição de um modelo preditivo de distribuição de solos com horizontes B textural e B nítico na paisagem de Lavras (MG).},

  Abstract                 = {Mapping rules based on the knowledge of regional soil patterns - soil pattern rules - can be acquired from a previous soil survey of a small but representative sample area called the reference area. They can then be used in new soil surveys carried out on wider areas; this allows both to select the observation points and to predict which soil unit occurs at non-observed points. A quantified formulation of these rules is proposed to use them within an automated soil survey procedure. The soil pattern rules of a reference area are formulated through rules which give probabilities of soil unit presence. These probabilities are then combined to give soil predictions outside the reference area from a set of observation points. The observation points are successively chosen by the soil survey procedure according to a pre-defined strategy which takes into account the estimated uncertainty of the earlier predictions. The technique was tested on the Middle Valley of the Herault river (France). Comparisons between actual and simulated soil maps show good results both in terms of quality and optimization of the number of observation points. Although further work is needed to achieve a fully operational tool, the soil survey procedure tested looks promising for regions with identifiable and repeating soil patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {Given the relative dearth of, and the huge demand for, quantitative spatial soil information, it is timely to develop and implement methodologies for its provision. We suggest that digital soil mapping, which can be defined as the creation, and population of spatial soil information systems (SSINFOS) by the use of field and laboratory observational methods, coupled with spatial and non-spatial soil inference systems, is the appropriate response. Problems of large extents and soil-cover complexity and coarse resolutions and short-range variability representation carry over from conventional soil survey to digital soil mapping. Meeting users' requests and demands and the ability to deal with spatially variable and temporally evolving datasets must be the key features of any new approach. In this chapter, we present a generic framework that recognises the procedures required. Within quantitatively defined physiographic regions, SSINFOS must be populated and spatial soil inference systems (SSINFERS) must be developed. When combined this will allow users to derive the data they require. Further work is required on the development of these systems, and on the data requirements, the optimal forms of inference and the appropriate representation of the products of digital soil mapping.},

This is done in this paper by computing at each site of the large region a mathematical distance between local soilscapes and those in the reference area. Soilscapes are represented by a cover frequency vector of elementary landscape classes (combinations of soil-forming factor classes) calculated within an area defined around the site under consideration. The application of this technique to four reference areas located in the Hérault?Libron?Orb valleys in the south of France demonstrated that: (1) the proposed soilscape distance was in good agreement with the degree of representativity of a reference area (i.e. percentage of soil classes already encountered in the reference area), (2) representative areas of different size and purity can be delineated from a soilscape distance map by applying a distance threshold, (3) expertise in delineating a reference area has a strong influence on its performances, i.e. size vs. purity of representative area. This suggests that the soilscape distance tested in this paper could be integrated in a classification procedure defining the optimal size and location of future reference areas.},

In this article we develop a spatial subsampling method for predicting an SCDF based on observations made on a hexagonal grid, similar to the one used in the Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We show that under quite general conditions, the proposed subsampling method provides accurate data-based approximations to the sampling distributions of various functionals of the SCDF predictor. In particular, it produces estimators of different population characteristics, such as the quantiles and weighted mean integrated squared errors of the empirical predictor. As an illustration, we apply the subsampling method to construct large-sample prediction bands for the SCDF of an ecological index for foliage condition of red maple trees in the state of Maine.},

  Abstract                 = {Since the 1930s, many of our top methodologists have argued that significance tests are not conducive to science. Bakan (1966) believed that ?everyone knows this? and that we slavishly lean on the crutch of significance testing because, if we didn?t, much of psychology would simply fall apart. If he was right, then significance testing is tantamount to psychology?s ?dirty little secret.? This paper will revisit and summarize the arguments of those who have been trying to tell us - for more than 70 years - that p values are not empirical. If these arguments are sound, then the continuing popularity of significance tests in our peer-reviewed journals is at best embarrassing and at worst intellectually dishonest.},

  Abstract                 = {The minimum size of subjects required for the research on human health, thermal comfort and productivity is a frequently asked question. In this paper the idea of power analysis, which helps to determine required sample size as well as to interpret research results, is introduced in order to promote good practice of power analysis in the context of human and building environment relationship research. How to calculate effect size from published article or experimental data is presented with plenty of examples. The effect sizes of several physiological and psychological measurements indicating the effect of indoor environment quality on human health, thermal comfort and productivity are presented, which could be worked as references when researchers planning their own studies. How to determine required sample size when planning a study and how to interpret the research results with power analysis are also illustrated step by step with samples. Finally how to make decisions when evaluating the study results is summarized. It is expected that these examples and the summary could help researchers to better apply power analysis in indoor environment quality (IEQ) studies. Some statistical terms used in this paper, such as power analysis, effect size, and t-test, etc., are explained in detail in the Appendix.},

This paper shows that objective functions can readily be defined for estimation by the method of maximum likelihood. In both cases an objective function can only be defined for a specified variogram so some prior knowledge about the spatial variation of the property of interest is necessary. This paper describes the principles of the method, using Spatial Simulated Annealing for optimization, and applies optimized sample designs to simulated data. For practical applications it seems that the most fruitful way of using the technique is for supplementing simple systematic designs that provide an initial estimate of the variogram.},

It is shown that the fitted variogram model can be used, given some simplifying assumptions, to predict the average purity of map units for a soil map of the region with a legend of simple units corresponding to the profile classes. An indication of the mean boundary interval of alternative maps is also given by the variogram model, although this should be treated with caution. The method proposed could therefore be useful when analysing observations from a reconnaissance soil survey, as an aid to selecting appropriate methods for more detailed survey.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping (DSM) depends on the identification of relationships between soil variables and informative covariates. These have components of variation that correspond to different spatial scales, so an analysis of variation by spatial scale may be both informative and of practical value for improving predictions of soil properties. In this chapter multiresolution analysis on wavelet basis functions is explained and illustrated, using both continuous variables and indicator variables defined on soil classes. A case study is presented in which a decomposition of sensor data on soil electrical conductivity resulted in better predictive models for soil properties. The use of wavelet methods for denoising data is illustrated. Because of the local properties of wavelet coefficients it is possible to smooth noise while retaining local variation at high spatial frequencies that appears to be significant. Finally, it is shown how wavelet packet transforms and best-basis identification can be used to develop a wavelet basis that is adapted to the properties of a particular data set.},

  Abstract                 = {Variograms of soil properties are usually obtained by estimating the variogram for distinct lag classes by the method-of-moments and fiting an appropriate model to the estimates. An alternative is to fit a model by maximum likelihood to data on the assumption that they are a realization of a multivariate Gaussian process. This paper compares the two using both simulation and real data. The method-of-moments and maximum likelihood were used to estimate the variograms of data simulated from stationary Gaussian processes. In one example, where the simulated field was sampled at different intensities, maximum likelihood estimation was consistently more efficient than the method-ofmoments, but this result was not general and the relative performance of the methods depends on the form of the variogram. Where the nugget variance was relatively small and the correlation range of the data was large the method-of-moments was at an advantage and likewise in the presence of data from a contaminating distribution. When fields were simulated with positive skew this affected the results of both the method-of-moments and maximum likelihood. The two methods were used to estimate variograms from actual metal concentrations in topsoil in the Swiss Jura, and the variograms were used for kriging. Both estimators were susceptible to sampling problems which resulted in over- or underestimation of the variance of three of the metals by kriging. For four other metals the results for kriging using the variogram obtained by maximum likelihood were consistently closer to the theoretical expectation than the results for kriging with the variogram obtained by the method-of-moments, although the differences between the results using the two approaches were not significantly different from each other or from expectation. Soil scientists should use both procedures in their analysis and compare the results.},

  Abstract                 = {It is often necessary to predict the distribution of mineral particles in soil between size fractions, given observations at sample sites. Because the contents in each fracti in necessarily sum to 100%, these values constitute a composition, which we may assume is drawn from a random compositional variate. Elements of a D-component composition are subject to non-stochastic constraints; they are constrained to lie on a D ? 1 dimensional simplex. This means we cannot treat them as realizations of unbounded random variables such as the multivariate Gaussian. For this reason, there are theoretical reasons not to use ordinary cokriging (or ordinary kriging) to map particle size distributions. Despite this, the compositional constraints on data on particle size fractions are not always accounted for by soil scientists. The additive log-ratio (alr) transform can be used to transform data from a compositional variate into a form that can be treated as a realization of an unbounded random variable. Until now, while soil scientists have made use of the alr transform for the spatial prediction of particle size, there has been concern that the simple back-transform of the optimal estimate of the alr-transformed variables does not yield the optimal estimate of the composition. A numerical approximation to the conditional expectation of the composition has been proposed, but we are not aware of examples of its application and it has not been used in soil science. In this paper, we report two case studies in which we predicted clay, silt and sand contents of the soil at test sites by ordinary cokriging of the alr-transformed data followed by both the direct (biased) backtransform of the estimates and the unbiased back-transform. We also computed estimates by ordinary cokriging of the untransformed data (which ignores the compositional constraints on the variables) for comparison. In one of our case studies, the benefit of using the alr transform was apparent, although there was no consistent advantage in using the unbiased back-transform. In the other case study, there was no consistent advantage in using the alr transform, although the bias of the simple back-transform was apparent. The differences between these case studies could be explained with respect to the distribution on the simplex of the particle size fractions at the two sites.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil scientists often have many covariates that they can use to predict soil properties by regression. They are ill-advised to use all available covariates uncritically, but methods for selection (whether informal or formal) that depend on data for both the predictors and the predictand are subject to selection bias. In this paper we propose an approach that uses automated methods for selecting variables, but which controls the rate of false rejection of true null hypotheses about the various predictive regression models that are considered. This approach reduces the effects of selection bias. Expert judgement is used both to determine the size of the pool of models that is searched (matching it to the strength of evidence for the existence of good models) and to ensure that the searched subset of possible models includes those that make sense, given our knowledge of the soil. The method is described, and a case study is presented on the prediction of soil properties in a large field in northern New South Wales, Australia.},

  Abstract                 = {The general linear model encompasses statistical methods such as regression and analysis of variance (anova) which are commonly used by soil scientists. The standard ordinary least squares (OLS) method for estimating the parameters of the general linear model is a design-based method that requires that the data have been collected according to an appropriate randomized sample design. Soil data are often obtained by systematic sampling on transects or grids, so OLS methods are not appropriate.Parameters of the general linear model can be estimated from systematically sampled data by model-based methods. Parameters of a model of the covariance structure of the error are estimated, then used to estimate the remaining parameters of the model with known variance. Residual maximum likelihood (REML) is the best way to estimate the variance parameters since it is unbiased. We present the REML solution to this problem. We then demonstrate how REML can be used to estimate parameters for regression and anova-type models using data from two systematic surveys of soil.We compare an efficient, gradient-based implementation of REML (ASReml) with an implementation that uses simulated annealing. In general the results were very similar; where they differed the error covariance model had a spherical variogram function which can have local optima in its likelihood function. The simulated annealing results were better than the gradient method in this case because simulated annealing is good at escaping local optima.},

There are several families of wavelet, and within any one family wavelets of different lengths and therefore smoothness and their corresponding scaling functions can be assembled into a collection of orthogonal functions. Such an assemblage can then be applied to filter spatial data into a series of independent components at varying scales in a single coherent analysis. The application requires no assumptions other than that of finite variance. The methods have been developed for processing signals and remote imagery in which data are abundant, and they need modification for data from field sampling. The paper describes the theory of wavelets. It introduces the pyramid algorithm for multiresolution analysis and shows how it can be adapted for fairly small sets of transect data such as one might obtain in soil survey. It then illustrates the application using Daubechies’s wavelets to two soil transects, one of gilgai on plain land in Australia and the other across a sedimentary sequence in England. In both examples the technique revealed strongly contrasting local features of the variation that had been lost by averaging in previous analyses and expressed them quantitatively in combinations of both scale and magnitude. Further, the results could be explained as the spatial effects of change in topography or geology underlying the variation in the soil.Analyse et éclairissement sur la variation du sol en utilisant les ondelettes RésuméUne ondelette est un noyau compact d’analyse qu’on peut passer sur une séquence de données pour quantifier la variation localement. Plusieurs familles d’ondelettes existent. Chaque famille est caractérisée par des fonctions d’échelle de longueurs d’ondes et de degrés de lissage différents, le tout constituant un ensemble de fonctions orthogonales. L’application de ces fonctions sur des données spatiales est une méthode d’analyse unique et cohérente qui permet de filtrer des données spatiales en identifiant des composantes indépendentes à différentes échelles. L’application n’éxige que l’hypothése d’une variance bornée. Ces méthodes ont été developpées pour le traitement de signaux qui contiennent énormement de données comme des images de télédétection. Elles necessitent des modifications avant de les appliquer sur des données d’échantillonage provenant du terrain. Cet article décrit la théorie d’ondelettes. Il introduit l’algorithme pyramidal pour une analyse à quelques résolutions. Il montre ensuite comment on peut adapter l’algorithme pour un ensemble de données peu nombreuses comme celles qu’on peut obtenir lors d’une prospection du sol sur des transects.Les resultats montrent l’application des ondelettes de Daubechies à deux transects pédologiques, lepremier situé sur une plaine marquée de gilgaï en Australie, et le second à travers une séquence de sediments jurassiques en Angleterre. Dans les deux exemples, la technique a révélé des contrastes bien marqués de certain traits locaux qui ont été totalement occultés dans des analyses antérieures basées sur le calcul des moyennes. La technique des ondelettes permet aussi une quantification de ces traits locaux, en fonction de l’échelle d’observation et de la magnitude. De plus, ces résultats peuvent être interprétés par les effets d’une variation spatiale de la topographie ou de la géologie qui sont à l’origine de la variation du sol.}, }},

Incorporation of chlorine into the residual organic molecule occurred. Citric acid was efficiently converted to chloroform at pH 7 by a pathway probably involving 3-ketoglutaric acid as an intermediate; in acidic or alkaline solution, yields of CHCl3 were lower. Several other enolizable keto acids (including all three isomers of resorcylic acid) were likewise precursors of CHCl3 or of substances which could thermally be converted to CHCl3; yields varied widely. Two substituted benzoic acids common to natural waters, p-hydroxybenzoic acid and vanillic acid, were decarboxylated by hypochlorite with the production of chlorophenols.},

In addition, the amount of Si, Mn, Fe, and Al in the extracting solutions was determined. It was found that NaOCl extracted more organic matter with less destruction of the oxides than procedures employing H2O2.

While most studies are looking at large scale associations between genetic markers and environmental variables, adaptation of plants can also happen on a fine scale. However, the predictive ability of large scale predictors is weak when considering microclimates and landscape heterogeneity in mountainous areas. In that context, DEM's derivatives have been proven useful but remain confidential. This research focuses on the alpine herb Biscutella laevigata subsp. laevigata L., an autotetraploid perennial plant, which occurs in small patches in a heterogeneous landscape. The objectives are firstly, to explore correlations between environmental variables, exclusively derived from two DEMs of different spatial resolutions, respectively 25 and 2 meters, and genetic markers. Secondly, to analyze the effect of different spatial resolutions on significant correlations. The most important result obtained is the large congruency between results from a population genomics and a spatial coincidence approach. In addition, three variables show interesting results that is altitude, duration of insolation and morphometric protection index, which is rarely used. And finally, better significances were found most of the times with the 25m DEM, which raises questions about the most appropriate scale of computation of geomorphological and environmental processes.},

  Abstract                 = {Urban soils are defined as soils which are severely influenced by various human activities, but not only by cultivation. These soils have assumed particular significance because they extend over large areas, are intensively used and are increasingly relevant in the consideration of land-use patterns. However, urban soils can bring about both considerable benefits and extreme risk for urban living. Therefore, an effective way of handling taxonomy for urban soils must be taken into account in spatial planning. The taxonomy of urban soils must take into consideration the fact that urban soils are mostly young soils, normally showing only weak signs of soil genesis. In contrast herein urban soils are often characterized by easily differentiable substrate-linked features. Since the early stages of soil genesis are mainly influenced by substrate properties, reasonable taxonomic differentiation of urban soils can be obtained by restricting consideration to substrate- linked properties. Proposals which were first presented during a ses- sion on Anthropogenic soils classifica- tion at the 2nd International Conference on Soil Classification in July 2005, in Petrozavodsk (Russia) are reflected here.},

  Abstract                 = {Os modelos de simulação são ferramentas essenciais para o entendimento da dinâmica da matéria orgânica do solo e da transformação de seus compartimentos em solos tropicais. Os objetivos deste estudo foram: (a) simular por meio do modelo Century os efeitos de sistemas de produção de milho sob adubação orgânica e mineral sobre a dinâmica da matéria orgânica em um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo, e (b) comparar os estoques de C orgânico total (COT), N total (NT) e dos compartimentos de C medidos por meio de métodos de laboratório e estimados pelo modelo Century na camada superficial (0-20 cm). A área em estudo, sob Floresta Atlântica (FA) até o ano de 1930, foi cultivada com milho e feijão por aproximadamente 50 anos, até à instalação do experimento no ano de 1984. Os tratamentos constaram de combinações entre três doses de adubo mineral, correspondentes a de 0, 250 e 500 kg ha -1 da fórmula 4-14-8, e duas doses de adubo orgânico (esterco bovino com palha de soja e feijão), nas doses de 0 e 40 m 3 ha -1 . Os métodos de laboratório incluíram determinações do COT, do NT, do C da biomassa microbiana (C MIC ), representando o compartimento ativo, e do C da fração leve (C FL ), referenciando o compartimento lento. O compartimento passivo foi obtido por diferença. A parametrização do modelo Century foi realizada a partir dos dados obtidos no experimento e na literatura, enquanto as simulações da dinâmica do COT, NT e dos compartimentos ativo de C lento e passivo incluíram as mudanças no uso da terra ocorridas de 1930 a 2050. O modelo Century estimou diminuição nos estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C desde a derrubada da FA até o início do experimento e apenas nos tratamentos com adubação orgânica foi observada recuperação desses estoques. O Cm IC e o C FL foram mais sensíveis às mudanças no manejo do que o COT, o que indica a importância desses compartimentos no estudo da dinâmica da matéria orgânica, especialmente em solos tropicais. Os estoques de COT, NT e dos compartimentos de C (lento e passivo), simulados pelo modelo Century, foram similares aos estoques medidos. Os estoques de COT (em Mg ha -1 de C), medidos e simulados pelo modelo Century, foram bem correlacionados (R 2 = 0,93; p < 0,01), assim como para o C do compartimento ativo (R 2 = 0,84; p < 0,05), lento (R 2 = 0,87; p < 0,05) e passivo (R 2 = 0,91; p < 0,05). Também para os estoques de NT (em Mg ha -1 de N), medidos e simulados pelo modelo Century, houve alta correlação (R 2 = 0,93; p < 0,01). O modelo Century demonstrou bom desempenho para simular a dinâmica da matéria orgânica em solos tropicais ácidos.},

  Abstract                 = {Depletion of soil organic matter (SOM) is a major component of soil degradation that threatens the sustainability of smallholder farming systems in Ethiopia. In this study, soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) dynamics following deforestation and subsequent cultivation were evaluated using natural abundance of 13C and 15N along a farm field chronosequence cleared from tropical dry Afromontane forest in south central Ethiopia. Soil samples were collected from five closely located farm fields cultivated for 7, 10, 26, 34 and 53 years after clearance and from an adjacent natural forest soil. All the soils in the study were Mollic Andosols/Humic Haplustands. The [delta]13C values of the SOC of the farm fields in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm layers were significantly elevated compared to the natural forest soil. In the 0-10 cm layer, the lowest [delta]13C value of -23.17[per mille sign]±0.36 was recorded from the natural forest soil and the highest value of -15.7[per mille sign]±1.50 from the 53-year-old farm field. Fractionation of the SOC of the bulk soil based on the [delta]13C values showed that in the 0-10 cm layer the SOC of the forest origin declined by 74.6%, which is equivalent to 54.1 Mg C ha-1 or 740 kg ha-1 year-1, where as SOC input from the agricultural crops was low (240 kg ha-1 year-1). However, part of the SOC of the forest origin lost from the surface 0-10 cm soil layer was translocated to the 10-20 cm layer. The SOC derived natural forest approached steady state around 30 years after cultivation while the SOC derived from agricultural crops reached steady state already after 10 years. The results show that the remaining forest derived SOC is recalcitrant while the SOC derived from agricultural crops has a relatively short mean residence time. The soils of the farm fields also showed increasing [delta]15N values indicating a loss of N from the system. The increasing [delta]15N values were consistent with the loss of total N along the chronosequence. A continued loss of N combined with insufficient input of fertilizer will result in a decreased productivity of the studied farming systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Geospatial measurements of ancillary sensor data, such as bulk soil electrical conductivity or remotely sensed imagery data, are commonly used to characterize spatial variation in soil or crop properties. Geostatistical techniques like kriging with external drift or regression kriging are often used to calibrate geospatial sensor data to specific soil or crop properties. More traditional statistical methods such as ordinary linear regression models are also commonly used. Unfortunately, some soil scientists see these as competing and unrelated modeling approaches and are unaware of their relationship. In this article we review the connection between the ordinary linear regression model and the more comprehensive geostatistical mixed linear model and describe when and under what conditions ordinary linear regression models represent valid spatial prediction models. The formulas for the ordinary linear regression model parameter estimates and best linear unbiased predictions are derived from the geostatistical mixed linear model under two different residual error assumptions; i.e., strictly uncorrelated (SU) residuals and effectively uncorrelated (EU) residuals. The theoretically optimal (best linear unbiased) and computable (linear unbiased) predictions and variance estimates derived under the EU error assumption are examined in detail. Statistical tests for detecting spatial correlation in LR model residuals are also reviewed, in addition to three LR model validation tests derived from classical linear modeling theory. Two case studies are presented that highlight and demonstrate the various parameter estimation, response variable prediction and model validation techniques discussed in this article.},

  Abstract                 = {A soil nutrient balance is a commonly used indicator to assess changes in soil fertility. In this paper, an earlier developed methodology by Stoorvogel and Smaling to assess the soil nutrient balance is given a major overhaul, based on growing insights and advances in data availability and modelling. The soil nutrient balance is treated as the net balance of five inflows (mineral fertilizer, organic inputs, atmospheric deposition, nitrogen fixation and sedimentation) and five outflows (crop products, crop residues, leaching, gaseous losses and erosion). This study aims to improve the existing methodology by making it spatially explicit, improving various transfer functions, and by modelling explicitly the uncertainties in the estimations. Spatially explicit modelling has become possible through a novel methodology to create a simulated land use map on the basis of the principles of traditional qualitative land evaluation. New literature data on the various inputs and outputs allowed improvement of the estimations of deposition, sedimentation, leaching, and erosion. Moreover, the uncertainty of the calculated soil nutrient balances was assessed. To illustrate the improved methodology, we applied it to Burkina Faso and revealed that nutrient depletion is occurring throughout the country at rates of -20+/-15kgNha-1 , -3.7+/-2.9kgPha-1 and -15+/-12kgKha-1 . The resulting spatial soil nutrient balances at the national level can constitute the basis for targeting soil fertility policies at lower levels.},

  Abstract                 = {The global carbon cycle has an important influence on global change. Soil organic carbon (SOC), the largest component of the terrestrial carbon pool, plays a vital role in the terrestrial carbon cycle and therefore knowledge of soil organic carbon pools and fluxes is required. This paper assesses typical values and measures of variation for soil organic carbon contents of soil-land use combinations in Belgium, further termed landscape units (LSU). Data from several heterogeneous data sets collected around the years 1990 and 2000 are used. Their heterogeneity is related to the purpose for which the soil carbon data were collected, the measurement technique, the nature and total depth of the sampled layers and the level of spatial aggregation with which the data were made available. In order to make integrated use of the data and present a spatial and temporal uncertainty assessment of the SOC contents of LSU, we exploit all available information on variability using simple statistical rules. Two thirds of the LSU under arable or grassland have lost SOC between 1990 and 2000 for the upper 20 cm. Approximately one third of these LSU show significantly decreased SOC stocks. The decreases are more pronounced in northern Belgium (region of Flanders), which is possibly due to specific manure regulations. The average SOC content of cropland in the upper 100 cm decreased from 8.8 kg C m2 in 1990 to 8.4 kg C m2 in 2000. A comparable decrease is observed under grassland, namely from 13.9 to 13.0 kg C m2. For soils, the highest SOC losses occur in the sandy soil associations of northern Belgium. LSU under forest could only be assessed for the year 2000. Forest soils store on average between 14.8 and 15.5 kg C m2 in the upper 100 cm of mineral soil, depending on forest type. These values are comparable to grassland but significantly higher than cropland.},

  Abstract                 = {Simple and reliable relationships exist between the change in UV absorbance (?A) of NOM when it is chlorinated and the formation of chlorinated byproducts. These relationships provide an approach for obtaining large amounts of data that can be used to interpret the kinetics, stoichiometry, and mechanism of the reactions. Analysis of these relationships suggests that the functional groups that are the major precursors for DBPs might be highly activated aromatic rings, as has been suggested previously, but that these groups have some fundamental differences from highly activated rings in pure compounds. The key evidence for this difference is that the UV absorbance of NOM decreases when dosed with even very low concentrations of chlorine, whereas the absorbance of pure compounds such as 3,5-DHBA and resorcinol increases. When hypochlorite species (HOCl and OCl-) are added to a solution containing NOM, between 1.6 and 4.1 Cl atoms become incorporated into NOM for each activated aromatic ring that is destroyed. The rate of Cl incorporation into organic molecules is very rapid initially and decreases steadily thereafter. Chlorine reduction on the other hand (or, equivalently, NOM oxidation) is negligible initially and then increases over time. The effect of these parallel processes is that the amount of Cl that becomes incorporated into organic molecules as a fraction of the amount of HOCl and OCl- consumed decreases from near 100% initially to near 20% over the course of the reaction. Considering that many of the carbon atoms in NOM probably do not participate in redox reactions with Cl, those that do must be oxidized quite substantially during the process, and it is likely that atoms other than C (particularly N) also provide some of the electrons to reduce Cl. Expanded use of ?A to study DBP-forming reactions is likely to lead to more insights into key aspects of the reaction mechanisms.},

The assessment methods ®rst determined the SOC density (C mass per unit area) for pedons in a database of soil properties, and then spatially distributed the SOC density to soil and soil/land use categories on a map. The results showed that the pedon SOC density is in¯uenced by drainage class, texture and land use/land cover. The SOC density estimation method signi®cantly in¯uences results and leads to differences of up to 6% in total estimated SOC stock for Flanders. Use of various spatial distributing methods creates differences of up to 2% in total estimated SOC stock. The largest difference in SOC stock estimate between any combination of assessment methods was 7% (125.6 Tg vs 134.9 Tg). These ®ndings emphasize the importance of complete spatial soil databases of high quality that reduce uncertainty of estimates for use in research examining the role of soils in the C cycle. The results indicate that the need for these databases is greater than the need to standardize methods to determine the spatial distribution of SOC. A map of the distribution of SOC density shows that in Flanders a large proportion of SOC is stored in sandy soils in the north of the territory},

This paper presents an approach to determine the relative sustainability of agricultural practices. A simple ranking procedure using a relative scoring method is proposed to discriminate among treatments based on the status of crop and soil parameters within different agroecosystem functions. Summing scores across agroecosystem functions allows for the identification of agricultural practices that are performing optimally based on functions included in the procedure. An example, using data from a long-term cropping systems experiment in the western Corn Belt, found the indexing procedure to successfully discern differences in overall performance across four agroecosystem functions between conventional [continuous corn (Zea mays L.) cropping sequence at a fertilization rate of 180 kg N h-1] and alternative {corn?oat (Avena sativa L.) 1 clover (Trifolium pratense L.)?grain sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench]?soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] cropping sequence at a fertilization rate of 90 kg N ha-1}management systems. The simplicity, inclusiveness, and inherent flexibility of the indexing procedure can be considered benefits and drawbacks, depending on the point of view taken. Data requirements of the approach, however, are stringent. Consequently, its most appropriate use may be with data from long-term agroecosystem experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter describes our methods and experiences of making a 1:250,000 georeferenced soil databases for Finland with digital soil mapping systems. We use the following source materials: maps of quaternary deposits, geophysical low-altitude flight measurements, various GIS - materials from different sources and old soil surveys. We are aware that our pretty simplified way of digital soil mapping, mostly based on a parent material (lithogenic) approach, is vulnerable to international criticism and that is why we explain why this is possible in Finland, which consists of young soils (<12,000 years).},

No Alto Solimões, pela maior proximidade do ambiente andino, há maior possibilidade de enriquecimento dos solos. Este trabalho teve por objetivo ampliar o conhecimento dos solos dessa região por meio da caracterização de atributos mineralógicos e químicos de três solos de uma toposseqüência na região de Benjamin Constant (AM), próximo à fronteira Brasil- Peru. Tais solos situam-se das partes mais elevadas até a várzea, sendo classificados como Argissolo Amarelo Ta alumínico abrupto, Plintossolo Argilúvico alumínico abrúptico e Neossolo Flúvico Ta eutrófico. Os resultados mostram que estes solos possuem maior riqueza de nutrientes e de minerais alteráveis, com menor grau de intemperismo, em comparação aos solos mais bem drenados da parte oriental da Amazônia, derivados de sedimentos mais antigos ou de rochas cristalinas. Os baixos teores de Fe e Mn no Plintossolo em todas as frações analisadas, em comparação aos demais solos da toposseqüência, indicam o predomínio de processos de remoção nesse ambiente, enquanto, no Neossolo Flúvico, a remoção é superada pela deposição de novos sedimentos, possibilitando a ocorrência em teores elevados de Fe e Mn. Os valores de capacidade máxima de adsorção de fosfato são baixos nos horizontes superficiais, tornando-se elevados nos horizontes subsuperficiais mais ricos em argila ou com ocorrência de plintita, podendo representar, em caso de erosão, um fator limitante ao cultivo agrícola.},

Entretanto, ainda não existe um método indireto considerado o melhor para a estimativa da erodibilidade do solo. O objetivo deste trabalho foi definir a melhor abordagem para se estimar a erodibilidade dos solos da bacia do alto rio Jardim - DF. Foram avaliados quatro métodos indiretos de estimativa da erodibilidade, os quais tiveram seus resultados discutidos e comparados com dados medidos. Os resultados do teste de comparação de médias t- Student indicaram que todos os métodos diferem significativamente dos dados medidos a 5% de significância. Os métodos de Denardin (1990), van der Knijff et al. (1999) e Stone & Hillborn (2002), em média, superestimaram os valores medidos, enquanto o nomograma de Wischmeier et al. (1971) os subestimaram. De acordo com os resultados obtidos, a adoção de um valor de K por classe de solo, como normalmente utilizado, não é recomendada, pois implica em erros consideráveis. Optou-se pelo uso do método de Denardin (1990), pois foi aquele que mais se aproximou do valor medido. Com base no método de Denardin (1990) e nos resultados de sua aplicação com os dados levantados na bacia de estudo, desenvolveu-se um novo método indireto de estimativa do valor de K, baseado unicamente no teor de argila da amostra. O método desenvolvido foi aplicado à bacia do rio Jardim de forma espacialmente interpolada e os resultados obtidos foram considerados melhores do que aqueles gerados com a adoção de um valor médio de K por classe de solo.},

The three pedons are dominated by vermiculite and vermiculite-illite interstratified minerals, and they have minor kaolinite, quartz and gibbsite. No hydroxy interlayered vermiculite (HIV) was found in the E horizon of the three pedons because the forest soils are very acidic and have very low Al contents. The presence of HIV in the spodic (Bhs) and argillic horizons (Bt) of the three pedons was associated with greater free Fe and Al contents (Fe d and Al d ), more favorable pH ranges, and coatings of organo-metallic complexes which prevented continuous weathering. The specific pedogenic process, clay illuviation and podzolization occurred sequentially in the Alishan area, and induced the unusual clay mineral distribution and transformation. The largest amounts of illite are in the C horizon and the amounts of vermiculite increased with decreasing soil depths. A reverse distribution between illite and vermiculite through the soil profile was observed. Illite was transformed to vermiculite due to the strong weathering environment associated with extremely low exchangeable K contents. The weathering sequence of clay minerals of Spodosols with fine textures in the study area is proposed as: illite ? vermiculite (or interstratified vermiculite-illite minerals) ? HIV and vermiculite.},

Replication provides the crucial test of the reliability and validity of facts, hypotheses and theories. It leads, when successful, to generalizable and predictable results. The new criterion is based on obtaining ?significant sameness? in related studies, in contrast to obtaining a significant difference in a single isolated study. This means determining whether the same model holds over many sets of data, and not what model fits best for one particular data set.},

  Abstract                 = {SOMs (Self Organising Maps) are derived from the machine learning literature and serve as a valuable method for representing data. In this paper, the use of SOMs as a technique for determining the most signi ? cant variables (or markers) in a dataset is described. The method is applied to the NMR spectra of 96 human saliva samples, half of which have been treated with an oral rinse formulation and half of which are controls, and 49 variables consisting of bucketed intensities. In addition, three simulations, two of which consist of the same number of samples and variables as the experimental dataset and a third that contains a much larger number of variables, are described. Two of the simulations contain known discriminatory variables, and the remaining is treated as a null dataset without any speci ? c discriminatory variables added. The described SOM method is contrasted to Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis, and a list of the markers determined to be most signi ? cant using both approaches was obtained and the differences arising are discussed. A SOM Discrimination Index (SOMDI) is de ? ned, whose magnitude relates to how strongly a variable is considered to be a discriminator. In order to ensure that the model is stable and not dependent on the random starting point of the SOM, one hundred iterations were performed and variables that were consistently of high rank were selected. A variety of approaches for data representation are illustrated, and the main theoretical principles of employing SOMs for determining which variables are most signi ? cant are outlined. Software used in this paper was written in-house, allowing greater ? exibility over existing packages, and tailored for the speci ? c application in hand.},

  Abstract                 = {The processes controlling the distribution and phases of Fe in soils and sediments of a forested coastal catchment in southeast Queensland, Australia are identi ? ed. The physicochemical attributes of 120 spatially distributed soil and sediment samples, along with geomorphic, geological and land-use characteristics were analysed using Kohonen's self organising maps (SOM) methodology. The SOM-based data analysis approach permits the analysis of complex multivariate datasets that are not well suited to traditional statistical methods. Across the catchment readily extractable Fe concentrations are low overall, despite a high proportion of Fe- concretions in many soils. However, two processes associated with elevated Fe occurrences are identi ? ed. Firstly, seasonal water-logging leads to the accumulation of Fe in clay-rich soils on lower slope positions. Mottling and the presence of lepidocrocite indicate cyclical redox conditions. Secondly, a high proportion of total readily extractable Fe is present in organically complexed form in the stream sediments. It is suggested that an accumulation of Fe-rich sediment and organic detritus in streams permits the release of Fe under anoxic conditions, which is then bound by organic material. Contrary to the ? ndings of previous studies, vegetation type does not affect Fe; there is no major difference between the concentrations of Fe of soils under pine plantation and native vegetation. Landform, however, does play an important role. Local depressions on gentle-sloped, low-lying terrain and associated with high topographic wetness indices were found to enhance seasonal redox processes. The groupings obtained from the SOM analyses were internally consistent and can be regarded as ?process groups?. The results show that SOM is a tool that can aid in the interpretation of complex datasets and help identify geochemical processes operating on a catchment scale.},

The primary information (or primary attribute) was obtained from an intensive grid soil sampling and the secondary spatial information from digital (or spectral) data from an aerial colour photograph of bare soil. The prediction methods were statistical (linear regression between soil properties and digital values) and geostatistical algorithms (ordinary kriging, ordinary kriging plus regression and kriging with varying local means). Mean square error (MSE) was used to evaluate the performance of the map prediction quality. The best prediction method for mapping organic matter, pH and potassium was kriging with varying local means in combination with the spectral data from the blue waveband with the smallest MSE indicating the highest precision. Maps from these kriged estimates showed that a combination of geostatistical techniques and digital data from aerial photograph could improve the prediction quality of soil management zones, which is the first step for site-specific soil management.},

Instead, observed changes are typically explained by differences in litter input. As a result, it is not well known if and how quickly newly incorporated C is stabilized in soils. Our goals were to find out how much soil C was stabilized in two different soil orders (Andisols and Inceptisols) and which are the responsible mechanisms of C stabilization. Furthermore, we looked for evidence that newly incorporated soil C was stabilized in these contrasting soil orders. We selected 25 sites in northwestern Ecuador with two paired plots per site: one plot where pasture was converted to secondary forest and one plot where forest was converted to pasture. In all the plots, soil C content, stocks, and stable isotope (?13C) signal were measured in the surface soil. The ?13C values were used to estimate the stocks of soil C derived from forest (Cdf) and from pasture (Cdp) in all plots. We calculated correlations between these stocks and soil and environmental characteristics to identify mechanisms of soil C stabilization. Our results show that long-term stabilization in Andisols was through formation of metal?humus complexes and allophane, while in Inceptisols long-term stabilization was through sorption to clay minerals. We found evidence that recently incorporated C was not stabilized in Andisols, while in Inceptisols, poorly crystalline (hydr-) oxides seemed to have stabilized part of this soil C. We conclude that unless soil C stabilizing mechanisms are explicitly considered, we will not be able to predict the direction and magnitude of changes in soil C stocks following land use changes in the tropics.},

As soil functions are now protected by law in Germany, urban soil quality has to be evaluated before soil management. We studied contributions from elemental carbon (EC) and soil organic matter (SOM) quality in topsoil horizons at seven sites in Stuttgart, Germany, differing in impurities by technogenic substrates. The most disturbed site was found at a disused railway area while high-density areas, public parks and garden areas showed varying degrees of disturbance by anthropogenic activities. For most soils, compounds derived from plant litter dominated organic matter (OM) quality characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Although high contents of EC (up to 70% of soil organic carbon) were indicated by thermal oxidation, this was not confirmed by aromatic C intensities in NMR spectra. Only for the highly aromatic railway soil were results for elemental carbon by thermal oxidation and NMR similar. As other technogenic substrates beside EC like plastics may also contribute in the long-term to OM in urban soils, new analytical techniques are therefore required. This knowledge will promote the evaluation of urban soil properties and their sustainable use.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite the abundance of methods for variable selection and accommodating spatial structure in regression models, there is little precedent for incorporating spatial dependence in covariate inclusion probabilities for regionally varying regression models. The lone existing approach is limited by difficult computation and the requirement that the spatial dependence be represented on a lattice, making this method inappropriate for areal models with irregular structures that often arise in ecology, epidemiology, and the social sciences. Here we present a novel method for spatial variable selection in areal generalized linear models that can accommodate arbitrary spatial structures and works with a broad subset of GLM likelihoods. The method uses a latent probit model with a spatial dependence structure where the binary response is taken as a covariate inclusion indicator for area-specific GLMs. The covariate inclusion indicators arise via thresholding of latent standard normals on which we place a conditionally autoregressive prior. We propose an efficient MCMC algorithm for computation that is entirely conjugate in any model with a conditionally Gaussian representation of the likelihood, thereby encompassing logistic, probit, multinomial probit and logit, Gaussian, and negative binomial regressions through the use of existing data augmentation methods. We demonstrate superior parameter recovery and prediction in simulation studies as well as in applications to geographic voting patterns and population estimation. Though the method is very broadly applicable, we note in particular that prior to this work, spatial population estimation/capture-recapture models allowing for varying list dependence structures has not been possible.}

While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scienti?c question at hand.},

A variabilidade das características estudadas foi pesquisada segundo três níveis de análise (global, por perfil e por profundidade). Conclui-se que as características médias de densidades do solo e de partículas e porosidade total foram bem amostradas nos três níveis considerados; a granulometria e a matéria orgânica foram adequadamente amostradas na análise global, em toda a área de estudo, todavia, por perfil e por profundidade, no solo PVe3, o número de amostras foi insuficiente. A variabilidade dos dados de retenção de água cresceu com o aumento da tensão hídrica em todos os níveis de análise e cresceu, linearmente, com o aumento da distância de coleta dos pontos amostrais. Os solos arenosos apresentaram maior variabilidade, sugerindo uma amostragem mais densa quanto às características físicas, químicas e físico-hídricas do que os solos de textura mais argilosa. Os resultados demonstraram que essas propriedades foram muito bem amostradas e que a variabilidade da retenção de água foi positivamente relacionada ao nível de tensão de água.},

  Abstract                 = {A robust new approach for describing and segmenting landforms which is directly applicable to precision farming has been developed in Alberta. The model uses derivatives computed from DEMs and a fuzzy rule base to identify up to 15 morphologically defined landform facets. The procedure adds several measures of relative landform position to the previous classification of Pennock et al. (Geoderma 40 (1987) 297-315; 64 (1994) 1-19). The original 15 facets can be grouped to reflect differences in complexity of the area or scale of application. Research testing suggests that a consolidation from 15 to 3 or 4 units provides practical, relevant separations at a farm field scale. These units are related to movement and accumulation of water in the landscape and are significantly different in terms of soil characteristics and crop yields. The units provide a base for benchmark soil testing, for applying biological models and for developing agronomic prescriptions and management options.},

  Abstract                 = {In an earlier paper, [1] an approach to the problem of systematic sampling was formulated, and the associated variance obtained. Several forms of the population were assumed. The efficiency of the systematic design as compared with the random and stratified random design was evaluated for these forms. It was remarked that as the size of sample increased the variance of a systematic design might also increase, contrary to the behavior of variances in the random sampling design. This possibility was verified in [2]. One approach to the study of systematic designs, given by Cochran [3] removed this difficulty to some extent by changing the problem to one of the expected variance, and supposing the elements of the population to be random variables. He showed that if the correlogram of these random variables is concave upwards, then the expected variance of the systematic design would be less, and often considerably less, than the variance of a stratified design. In the present paper the results of the earlier papers are extended to the systematic sampling of clusters of equal and unequal sizes. Some comments on systematic sampling in two dimensions are included. In section 2 we derive two theorems that have considerable applications in many parts of sampling. Although it has been common for people working in sampling theory to tell each other that these theorems ought to be true, yet no reference seems to exist. In section 3 we develop the implications of a remark [1, p. 13] that in designing sample surveys we should try to induce negative correlation between strata. In Theorem 3 we obtain sufficient conditions for the correlation to be negative. The lemma and Theorem 4 given in Section 4 enable us to extend the uses of Theorem 3 in practice. As an application of these results, we show that if a population has a concave upwards correlogram, and if strata are defined in an optimum fashion for the selection of one element at random from each stratum, then we can define a systematic type design that will be more efficient than independent random selection from each stratum. In sections 5 and 6 we obtain various results in the systematic sampling of clusters largely as applications of the more general theorems of the earlier sections. In general the results are of a nature similar to those of [1] and [3] in that the formulae show the conditions under which systematic sampling may be expected to be more efficient than random or stratified random sampling. We have not, however, applied these formulae to specified types of populations. From [1, 2 and 3] it is already apparent that this work will be useful and such studies should be more valuable when made in connection with important types of surveys or data than when made as illustrations in a general paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Several metals in urban soils of Seville were extracted by two methods, which respectively give estimates of the available and quasi total contents. Although the soils did not show strong heterogeneity in their general properties, high dispersion of the contents in those metals with greater relative availability, Cu, Pb and Zn, as compared to others suggested that pollution with these three metals could occur in some sampling sites. It was shown that the contents in these metals tend to increase as the historic quarters of the city are approached. Using reference values given by the Queebec Ministry of Environment it was shown that those green areas closer to the historic centre present contents in Pb, Zn and particularly Cu that often exceed the acceptable limits for residential, recreational and institutional sites. From background contents for Seville soils estimated from a park located on the outskirts, a pollution load index (PLI) for each sampling site was calculated for the set of these three metals. It was shown that the PLI tends to increase as tra?c density increases and as distance from main tra?c decreases, but poor regressions were obtained, suggesting that other variables di?erent from tra?c should be considered.},

  Abstract                 = {Grassland management affects soil organic carbon (SOC) content and a variety of management options have been proposed to sequester carbon. However, studies conducted in Brazilian pastures have shown divergent responses for the SOC depending on management practices. Our objective was to evaluate the effects of management on SOC stocks in grasslands of the Brazilian states of Rondônia and Mato Grosso, and to derive region-speci ? c factors for soil C stock change associated with different management conditions. Compared to SOC stocks in native vegetation, degraded grassland management decreased SOC by a factor of 0.91±0.14, nominal grassland management reduced SOC stock for Oxisols by a relatively small factor of 0.99 ±0.08, whereas, SOC storage increased by a factor of 1.24±0.07 with nominal management for other soil types. Improved grassland management on Oxisols increased SOC storage by 1.19±0.07, relative to native stocks, but there were insuf ? cient data to evaluate the impact of improved grassland management for other soil types. Using these results, we also evaluated the potential for grassland management to sequester or emit C to the atmosphere, and found that degraded grassland management decreased stocks by about 0.27?0.28 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1 ; nominal management on Oxisols decreased C at a rate of 0.03 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1 , while nominal management on others soil types and improved management on Oxisols increased stocks by 0.72 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1 and 0.61 Mg C ha ?1 yr ?1 , respectively. Therefore, when well managed or improved, grasslands in Rondônia and Mato Grosso states have the potential to sequester C.},

  Abstract                 = {Sustainable land management decisions at all scales require solid, science-based information. Soil quality assessment can provide this regarding soil physical, chemical, and biological characteristics and the ability to provide ecosystem and societal services. Our objective was to make a regional assessment of soils in the Garhwal Himalayas to determine their ability to perform various functions and respond to external influences. Five functional categories were assessed using 13 soil parameters focused on ecological sustainability. Human land use effects on soils were referenced to natural woodlands at each landscape position. Within upper-slope regions, flora and fauna habitat, moisture retention, organic matter and nutrient cycling, air and water infiltration and resistance to erosion were decreased 35, 27, 24, 24, and 9%, respectively. At mid-slope positions the order and magnitude of decrease were organic matter and nutrient cycling, flora and fauna habitat, and moisture retention (26, 22, and 16%, respectively). Changes within the valley were lowest, averaging ? 3% for flora and fauna habitat and ? 13% for organic matter and nutrient cycling. We conclude that the minimum data set (MDS) used provided a representative assessment of soil quality and could serve as a basis for assessment in similar tropical watersheds},

  Abstract                 = {Many lands in the tropics are abandoned after few seasons of shifting cultivation due to loss of soil fertility. There is a great need for characterizing these soils for reforestation or revegetation using conservation farming systems. This study investigate the variability of soil pH, electrical conductivity (EC), clay content, organic C and available P in a tropical Alfisol and its spatial dependence subsequent to shifting cultivation. These parameters were measured in a total of 132 samples obtained from a 45 by 45 m area according to a pre-determined sampling grid. The coefficient of variation for the parameters ranged from 7% to 44%. The variability was assessed by conventional statistical methods and semi-variograms for spatial dependence using geostatistics. All the soil properties except soil pH exhibited spatial dependence at the distances measured. However, EC showed less spatial dependency when compared with clay, organic matter and available P contents. The spatial auto-correlation was strongest for soil organic C, less for clay and EC and least fl~r available P. EC showed a spatial correlation to a highest distance while the organic C showed spatial correlation to a lowest distance. All properties that showed a spatial dependence exhibited high nugget variance. The parameters obtained from the semi-variograms were used to interpolate the values at unmeasured locations using block kriging. It showed that EC is not a limiting factor lot crop production in these areas used for shifting cultivation. The organic C levels were low other than in few pockets showing the need in increasing the organic matter contents before cropping again. Available P contents were also limiting where cereals, soybean, maize and grasses which has a low P demand may be included in any conservation farming systems. The field variability obtained by block kriging is useful in applying soil amendments in pockets rather than to the total field to optimize resource use. This study shows the potential of geostatistics in agronomic applications.},

  Abstract                 = {In Brazil, most Eucalyptus stands have been planted on Cerrado (shrubby savanna) or on Cerrado converted into pasture. Case studies are needed to assess the effect of such land use changes on soil fertility and C sequestration. In this study, the influence of Cerrado land development (pasture and Eucalyptus plantations) on soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (SON) stocks were quantified in southern Brazil. Two contrasted silvicultural practices were also compared: 60 years of short-rotation silviculture (EUCSR) versus 60 years of continuous growth (EUCHF). C and N soil concentrations and bulk densities were measured and modelled for each vegetation type, and SOC and SON stocks were calculated down to a depth of 1 m by a continuous function. Changes in SOC and SON stocks mainly occurred in the forest floor (no litter in pasture and up to 0.87 kg C m2 and 0.01 kg N m2 in EUCSR) and upper soil horizons. C and N stocks and their confidence intervals were greatly influenced by the methodology used to compute these layers. C/N ratio and 13C analysis showed that down to a depth of 30 cm, the Cerrado organic matter was replaced by organic matter from newly introduced vegetation by as much as 75?100% for pasture and about 50% for EUCHF, poorer in N for Eucalyptus stands (C/N larger than 18 for Eucalyptus stands). Under pasture, 0?30 cm SON stocks (0.25 kg N m2) were between 10 and 20% greater than those of the Cerrado (0.21 kg N m2), partly due to soil compaction (limit bulk density at soil surface from 1.23 for the Cerrado to 1.34 for pasture). Land development on the Cerrado increased SOC stocks in the 0?30 cm layer by between 15 and 25% (from 2.99 (Cerrado) to 3.86 (EUCSR) kg C m2). When including litter layers, total 0?30 cm carbon stocks increased by 35% for EUCHF (4.50 kg C m2) and 53% for EUCSR (5.08 kg C m2), compared with the Cerrado (3.28 kg C m2), independently of soil compaction.

  Abstract                 = {The variogram is central to any geostatistical survey, but the precision of a variogram estimated from sample data by the method of moments is unknown. It is important to be able to quantify variogram uncertainty to ensure that the variogram estimate is sufficiently accurate for kriging. In previous studies theoretical expressions have been derived to approximate uncertainty in both estimates of the experimental variogram and fitted variogram models. These expressions rely upon various statistical assumptions about the data and are largely untested. They express variogram uncertainty as functions of the sampling positions and the underlying variogram. Thus the expressions can be used to design efficient sampling schemes for estimating a particular variogram. Extensive simulation tests show that for a Gaussian variable with a known variogram, the expression for the uncertainty of the experimental variogram estimate is accurate. In practice however, the variogram of the variable is unknown and the fitted variogram model must be used instead. For sampling schemes of 100 points or more this has only a small effect on the accuracy of the uncertainty estimate. The theoretical expressions for the uncertainty of fitted variogram models generally overestimate the precision of fitted parameters. The uncertainty of the fitted parameters can be determined more accurately by simulating multiple experimental variograms and fitting variogram models to these. The tests emphasize the importance of distinguishing between the variogram of the field being surveyed and the variogram of the random process which generated the field. These variograms are not necessarily identical. Most studies of variogram uncertainty describe the uncertainty associated with the variogram of the random process. Generally however, it is the variogram of the field being surveyed which is of interest. For intensive sampling schemes, estimates of the field variogram are significantly more precise than estimates of the random process variogram. It is important, when designing efficient sampling schemes or fitting variogram models, that the appropriate expression for variogram uncertainty is applied.},

The methods of logic were used in arguments presented to demonstrate the validity of concepts and the correctness of terms proposed herein, as rue11 as for the rebuttal of their traditionally accepted counterparts. The subjecfs discussed and the conclusions thereof were the following : 1. DEFINITION OF SOIL. Starting from the accepted fact that the definitions of soi1 found in the literature on the subject do not lead to a consensus as to what is soil, an inductive analogical argument was used to show that the incongruent situation of Pedology in the context of Science should be corrected. It was concluded that Pedology relates coherently with other divisions of Science by taking responsibility for the study of regolith as defined in the tezt. Consequently, ii was possible to present a straightforward edaphological definition of soil; 2. NATURE AND BEHAVIOR OF THE SOIL. The argument was developed starting from the distinction between what is intrinsic and what is inherent to the soil. It was logically concluded that the nature of the soi1 is defined by its characteristics whereas behavior is indicated by its properties. Some applications of these concepts were indicated and compared with other alternatives found in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {The Nhecolândia is a sub-region of the Brazilian Pantanal wetland, where saline and freshwater lakes coexist in close proximity. Measurements of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content and analysis of fluorescence excitation?emission matrices (EEM) were conducted in an effort to characterize spatial variability in concentration and source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and to further understand the hydrochemical functioning of this complex environment. Increasing pH under the influence of evaporation resulted in an increasing DOC solubility ranging from 50 to over 300 mgC L ? 1 in surface water. Spectrofluorescence characterisation indicates the presence of several families of dissolved organic matter (fulvic and humic-type and proteinaceous materials), which are related to the type of lake and its hydro?bio?geochemical functioning. Moreover, the fluorescence signatures from lake water DOM and from surrounding soil?water-extracted organic matter (WEOM) show strong similarities although some labile proteinaceous compounds disappeared during humification. Results from the characterisation of DOM and WEOM not only suggest that spectrofluorescence is a reliable technique for the tracing of water flows, but also for the marking of the origin of organic horizons in this environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Regression models of the forms proposed by Scheffé and by Becker have been widely and usefully applied to describe the response surfaces of mixture systems. These models do not contain a constant term. It has been common practice to test the statistical significance of these mixture models by the same statistical procedures used for other regression models whose constant term is absent (e. g., because the regression must pass through the origin). In this paper we show that the common practice produces misleading results for mixtures. The mixture models require a different set of F, R2, and RA 2 statistics. The correct mixture statistics correspond to a physically consistent null hypothesis and are also consistent with the expression of the mixture model in the older "slack-variable" form. An illustrative example is included.},

Com o objetivo de estudá-los, foram caracterizados morfológica, física, química e mineralogicamente e classificados sete perfis de Neossolos de ocorrência comum nesse ambiente insular, sendo dois Litólicos, um ?Saprolítico?, três Regolíticos e um Flúvico. Os Neossolos Litólicos apresentam contato lítico constituído por fragmentos de rocha a menos de 50 cm de profundidade. O Neossolo ?Saprolítico? apresenta o contato lítico superior aos 50 cm de profundidade, porém precedido por rochas parcialmente decompostas (saprolito), que preservam ainda sua estrutura original. Os Neossolos Regolíticos estão relacionados aos depósitos sedimentares marinhos e são constituídos, predominantemente, por grãos bioclásticos carbonáticos. O Neossolo Flúvico, de origem colúvio-aluvial, apresenta camadas alternadas de materiais distintos, notoriamente, pela textura e mineralogia. Os Neossolos Litólicos foram adequadamente classificados segundo a nova versão do SiBCS (Embrapa, 2006), que inclui o subgrupo ?fragmentário?, sugerido durante o desenvolvimento deste trabalho. Os outros Neossolos não foram adequadamente enquadrados, ora por apresentarem características peculiares, ora pela ausência de termos mais apropriados, que melhor explicitassem suas características distintas. Sugere-se a inclusão no SiBCS da subordem dos Neossolos Saprolíticos, do grande grupo dos Neossolos Regolíticos Psamíticos, e dos subgrupos dos Neossolos Regolíticos Psamíticos bioclásticos carbonáticos e Neossolos Flúvicos Ta eutróficos bioclásticos carbonáticos.},

  Abstract                 = {The impact of different land use types on soil quality was evaluated by measuring several soil properties that are sensitive to stress or disturbance and by using two synthetic approaches, i.e. a numerical quality index and multivariate analysis. A Minimum Data Set of soil indicators was selected including physical (texture, bulk density and water holding capacity), chemical (pH, cation exchange capacity, electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total and mineral nitrogen, available K, Ca, Mg, P contents and total Cd, Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn contents) and biological (microbial biomass, fungal mycelium, soil potential respiration and potentially mineralizable nitrogen) parameters. These parameters were assayed on soil samples collected with seasonal frequency (except for physical parameters, determined only in autumn) in an area of Southern Italy under different land use types (i.e. permanent crops, grazing lands, shrublands, coniferous and mixed forests). Moreover, for most of the land use types, a further distinction on the basis of topographic position (hill, middle-hill and plain) was carried out. Annual means of the data (except for texture) were used to calculate a soil quality index (SQI) and elaborated by multivariate analyses (Cluster Analysis and Principal Component Analysis, PCA) in order to distinguish among different soil quality classes. Data indicated a clear difference in soil quality among the studied areas: low soil quality (SQI < 0.55) in almost all permanent crops; intermediate soil quality (0.55 < SQI < 0.70) in shrublands, grazing lands, coniferous forest and middle-hill olive grove (the only crop with an herb layer on the soil surface); high soil quality (SQI > 0.70) in mixed forests. Results suggested that the permanent crop management had generally a strong negative impact on soil quality, while the moderate grazing activity and the crop management that leaves an herb cover on the soil had a lower negative impact. Nevertheless, the abandonment of cultivated lands, with consequent development of shrublands, produced an improvement of soil quality suggesting a good recovery capacity in the studied soil.},

Para tanto, foi defi nido e delimitado o campo de trabalho do sistema de apoio à decisão seguindo-se para a construção do modelo conceitual com base no conhecimento adquirido na literatura pertinente, para depois traduzi-lo em telas de ação e fl uxogramas de decisão. Terminados estes procedimentos iniciou-se a codificação do modelo em linguagem de programação (Delphi 6.0). Paralelamente foram realizados testes de validação do sistema quanto a usabilidade e coerência, sendo os erros ajustados. Finalmente, foram gerados os arquivos executáveis do sistema para sua instalação e posterior disponibilização.},

The betas are standardized coefficients of regression of a dependent variable upon the proportions of families in the classes of the marginal income and education distributions. They measure the relative contribution of families in these classes to the over-all per cent saturation of the dependent variable in the tract. The coefficients were estimated by techniques developed in the first portion of the paper; estimation by classical regression methods would have been impossible because of multicollinearity. The empirical results are in substantial agreement with findings from regressions of the dependent variables upon the mean values of income and education, and their squares. The statistical devices appear to be useful in exploratory empirical research.},

It was maybe the most affected entity in the world, due to the fact that a debt crisis followed right after the financial one. In this context, the decision makers had to tackle the issues in a very fast and different manner in order to avoid the end of Eurozone's existence and of the European Union itself. Based on the hypothesis that changes have occurred at the EU's decision level and using the qualitative and quantitative methods of research, our purpose is to show the extent to which the crisis influenced the decision making process and the decisions themselves. },

  Abstract                 = {Soil sampling and analysis of hydromorphic meadow soils were combined with semi-structured interviews to discern the multiple forms of local agricultural practices and knowledge in a community located in SW Hungary. Particular attention was extended to the role of gender in affecting soil management and knowledge and thereby soil reaction and fertility. The findings suggest that gender-specific forms of soil management directly alter soil status with lowered pH and macronutrient values in male-controlled cash-crop plots and excessive amounts of P2O5 on femalecontrolled subsistence plots. General soil classification likewise varied according to gender. To determine soil productivity potential, women mostly relied on a conventional economic index (the Gold Crown system) and general descriptive terminology, while men tended to be sensitised to soil texture. As the study is not based on an extensive survey, the results presented here should be considered preliminary and further expansion of interviews and soil sampling will be attempted in the future. These results nevertheless indicate that examining variability within local soil management systems is crucial to understanding anthropogenic impacts on soil dynamics.},

In this brief article, I first discuss some of the merits of reporting CIs and mention several sources that advocate the use if CIs, and I further elucidate their computation and interpretation in various circumstances. Second, I discuss a caveat regarding the use of CIs that apparently has not been widely recognized, although it is fairly obvious. The point to be made is that violation of assumptions that affect the tree value of ?(the probability of a Type I error) in a significance test will also affect the precision of the corresponding 100(1 - ?)% CI.},

Problems with several predictive data layers were identified. Very limited numbers of data layers were required to model spatial distribution of soils; and these were landscape driven. The success of extrapolation strategies was related to the extent of identified correspondences between trial and test areas. Relationships were more easily defined for nonglaciated areas.},

  Abstract                 = {We review various recent approaches to making digital soil maps based on geographic information systems (GIS) data layers, note some commonalities and propose a generic framework for the future. We discuss the various methods that have been, or could be, used for fitting quantitative relationships between soil properties or classes and their ?environment?. These include generalised linear models, classification and regression trees, neural networks, fuzzy systems and geostatistics. We also review the data layers that have been, or could be, used to describe the ?environment?. Terrain attributes derived from digital elevation models, and spectral reflectance bands from satellite imagery, have been the most commonly used, but there is a large potential for new data layers. The generic framework, which we call the scorpan-SSPFe (soil spatial prediction function with spatially autocorrelated errors) method, is particularly relevant for those places where soil resource information is limited. It is based on the seven predictive scorpan factors, a generalisation of Jenny?s five factors, namely: (1) s: soil, other or previously measured attributes of the soil at a point; (2) c: climate, climatic properties of the environment at a point; (3) o: organisms, including land cover and natural vegetation; (4) r: topography, including terrain attributes and classes; (5) p: parent material, including lithology; (6) a: age, the time factor; (7) n: space, spatial or geographic position. Interactions (*) between these factors are also considered. The scorpan-SSPFe method essentially involves the following steps: (i) Define soil attribute(s) of interest and decide resolution q and block size b. (ii) Assemble data layers to represent Q. (iii) Spatial decomposition or lagging of data layers. (iv) Sampling of assembled data (Q) to obtain sampling sites. (v) GPS field sampling and laboratory analysis to obtain soil class or property data. (vi) Fit quantitative relationships (observing Ockham?s razor) with autocorrelated errors. (vii) Predict digital map. (viii) Field sampling and laboratory analysis for corroboration and quality testing. (ix) If necessary, simplify legend or decrease resolution by returning to (i) or improve map by returning to (v). Finally, possible applications, problems and improvements are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Precision Agriculture brings the information revolution to agriculture. However, it is a fundamental requirement for the provision of quality information that a sufficient quantity relevant data has been previously obtained and analysed. For Precision Agriculture, the data sets will be required to embrace a range of crop, soil, landscape and other environmental attributes over significant areas. While there is no doubting the quantity/density of data obtainable from modern crop yield sensors, the quantity and density of data gathered on other important variables is less than optimal. The ultimate solution is the development of real-time sensors for these attributes. In the mean time, the conflict between manual sampling expense and sampling scheme resolution has lead to a grid sampling density for most attributes that fails to capture the true variability within a field. This dilemma must be overcome while the community awaits more technological solutions. Here a new formal method of spatial sampling, the variance quad-tree (VQT) method, is introduced. This scheme samples sparsely in uniform areas and more intensively where variation is large. This is motivated by a non-stationary covariance structure of the variables of interest. Previous work has shown this to be the case for spatial variation of crop yield. The method is equivalent to sampling on a regular grid in a transformed space, the method implicitly defining the transformation. Applications for the VQT method should include sampling for Digital Elevation Models (DEM), soil sampling and weed density estimation. The method is compared with grid sampling and ?smart? sampling methods.},

The concepts of hierarchy, grain, extent, scale and variability are discussed. Slight modifications to the Hoosbeek-Bryant scheme to deal with spatial and temporal scales and various types of quantitative models are suggested. Approaches to aggregation or upscaling are reviewed. The contributions of representative elementary volume (REV), variograms, fractal theory, multi-resolution analysis using wavelets, critical point phenomena, renormalisation groups and transfer functions are discussed followed by a brief presentation of some ecological approaches including extrapolation by lumping, extrapolation by increasing model extent and extrapolation by explicit integration. A clear distinction must be made between additive and non-additive variables. The scaling of the former is much less problematic than the latter. Corroboration of any approach by testing against the aggregated values seems problematic. Methods of disaggregation or downscaling including transfer functions, mass-preserving or pycnophylactic methods are also discussed. In order to make quantitative advances, nested sampling or reanalysis of data in land information systems to obtain variance information over a complete range of scales is required. Finally an appeal is made for work to begin on a quantitative scale-explicit theory of soil variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) have become a ?white-hot? topic in the area of soil science and environmental research. Most current PTF research focuses only on the development of new functions for predicting soil physical and chemical properties for different geographical areas or soil types while there are also efforts to collate and use the available PTFs. This paper reviews the brief history of the use of pedotransfer functions and discusses types of PTFs that exist. Different approaches to developing PTFs are considered and we suggest some principles for developing and using PTFs. We propose the concept of the soil inference systems (SINFERS), where pedotransfer functions are the knowledge rules for inference engines. A soil inference system takes measurements we more-or-less know with a given level of (un)certainty, and infers data that we do not know with minimal inaccuracy, by means of properly and logically conjoined pedotransfer functions. The soil inference system has a source, an organiser and a predictor. The sources of knowledge to predict soil properties are collections of pedotransfer functions and soil databases. The organiser arranges and categorises the PTFs with respect to their required inputs and the soil types from which they were generated. The inference engine is a collection of logical rules selecting the PTFs with the minimum variance. Uncertainty of the prediction can be assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. The inference system will return the predictions of soil physical and chemical properties with their uncertainties based on the information provided. Uncertainty in the prediction can be quantified in terms of the model uncertainty and input data uncertainty. In order to avoid extrapolation, a method was developed to quantify the degree of belonging of a soil sample within the training set of a PTF. With the first approach to a soil inference system, we can optimally predict various important physical and chemical properties from the information we have utilising PTFs as the knowledge rules.},

Additionally analysis based on non-stationarity of a variable and the use of ancillary information are demonstrated as encompassing modern regression techniques, including generalised linear modelsGLM., generalised additive modelsGAM., classification and regression treesRT.and neural networksNN.. Three resolutions of interest are discussed. Case studies are used to illustrate different pedometric techniques, and a variety of ancillary data. The case studies focus on predicting different soil properties and classifying soil in an area into soil classes defined a priori. Different techniques produced different error of interpolation. Hybrid methods such as CLORPT with geostatistics offer powerful spatial prediction methods, especially up to the catchment and regional extent. It is shown that the use of each pedometric technique depends on the purpose of the survey and the accuracy required of the final product.},

The most variable properties were depth to mottling, depth to fine- textured discontinuity, horizon thickness, texture, and chroma of the B2t horizon, percent of mottles having chromas of two or less, and grade of structure. Hue, value, and pH of all hori- zons, texture of the IIB horizon, and size and shape of struc- ture were the least variable. 54% of the profiles had IIB horizons in areas mapped as soils in which this horizon was lacking; 78% had IIB horizons in areas mapped as soils having this horizon. Little difference in other properties was noted between areas mapped as soils representing the two conditions. These soils were correctly classified with regard to soil series at 37% of the 220 observations. Careful study in such complex areas is essential before establishing a legend.},

  Abstract                 = {This monograph deals with a class of statistical models that generalizes classical linear models to include many other models that have been found useful in statistical analysis. These other models include log-linear models for the analysis of data in the form of counts, probit and logit models for data in the form of proportions (ratios of counts), and models for continuous data with constant proportional standard error. In addition, important types of models for survival data are covered by the class. An important aspect of the generalization is the presence in all the models of a linear predictor based on a linear combination of explanatory or stimulus variables. The variables may be continuous or categorical (or indeed a mixture of the two), and the existence of a linear predictor means that the concepts of classical regression and analysis-of-variance models, insofar as they refer to the estimation of parameters in a linear predictor, carry across directly to the wider class of model. In particular, the ideas underlying factorial models, including those of additivity, interaction, polynomial contrasts, aliasing, etc., all appear in the wider context. Generalized linear models have a common algorithm for the estimation of parameters by maximum likelihood; this uses weighted least squares with an adjusted dependent variate, and does not require preliminary guesses to be made of the parameter values. The book is aimed at applied statisticians and postgraduate students in statistics, but will be most useful, at least in part, to undergraduates and to numerate biologists. More mathematical sections are marked with asterisks and may be omitted at first reading. Some mathematics has been relegated to the first four appendices, while the fifth contains information on computer software for the fitting of generalized linear models. The book requires the reader to have a knowledge of matrix theory, including generalized inverses, together with basic ideas of probability theory, including orders of magnitude in probability. As far as possible, however, the development is self-contained, though necessarily fairly condensed because of the constraints on a monograph in this series. Further reading is giv€n in the bibliographic sections of various chapters, and the theory is illustrated with a diverse set of worked examples. We are grateful to Professor J.V. Zidek of the University of British Columbia and to the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, Canada, for the opportunity to undertake an intensive spell of writing.

  Abstract                 = {Cook’s Distance (Di) is used for assessing influence in regression models. The usual criterion is that a point is influential if Di exceeds the median of the Fp,n-p distribution, where p is the number of regression parameters. The practice developed here at Massey Albany is to teach the guideline Di>0.7 for p=2, Di> 0.8 for p=3, Di> 0.85 for p>3, where n≥15. It is not known if this guideline is used elsewhere. Teaching Guideline Cook’s Distance (Di) is an influence measure based on the difference between the regression parameter estimates β ˆ and what they become if the ith data point is deleted, β −i ˆ , say. There are numerical rules for assessing Cook’s Di but the rules tend to be rough guidelines, and textbook authors differ in their advice. The most common criterion quoted around the world appears to be to declare the ith point influential if Di exceeds the median of the Fp, n-p distribution, where p is the number of regression coefficients (including the intercept) and n the number of data. This guideline is justified on a mixture of theoretical and practical grounds. However Fp,n-p(0.5) is seldom tabulated, and needs to be computed for each situation, which seems unnecessary effort for a rough-and-ready guideline.},

Positively skewed distribution and possible outlying values of Pb and other heavy metals were observed. Box?Cox transformation was applied in order to achieve normality in the data set and to reduce the effect of outliers. Geostatistical analyses were carried out, including calculation of experimental variograms and model fitting. The ordinary point kriging estimates of Pb concentration were mapped. Kriging standard deviations were regarded as the standard deviations of the interpolated pixel values, and a second map was produced, that quantified the probability of Pb concentration higher than a threshold value of 1000 mg/kg. These maps provide valuable information for hazard assessment and for decision support.},

However it has not been previously noted in print that, prior to their principal components (PCs) analysis on tree ring networks, they carried out an unusual data transformation which strongly affects the resulting PCs. Their method, when tested on persistent red noise, nearly always produces a hockey stick shaped first principal component (PC1) and overstates the first eigenvalue. In the controversial 15th century period, the MBH98 method effectively selects only one species (bristlecone pine) into the critical North American PC1, making it implausible to describe it as the ?dominant pattern of variance?. Through Monte Carlo analysis, we show that MBH98 benchmarks for significance of the Reduction of Error (RE) statistic are substantially under-stated and, using a range of cross-validation statistics, we show that the MBH98 15th century reconstruction lacks statistical significance.},

These extractants are less useful in distinguishing forms of Al in soils. Spodic horizons contained much more pyrophosphate-extract- able Fe and Al than other soil materials. A criterion for spodic horizons could be based upon pyrophosphate-extractable Al, Fe, and possibly C. The rusty mottles of several Aquepts and Aqualfs and some placic horizons low in organic matter con- tained goethite as well as amorphous inorganic Fe.

  Abstract                 = {Current methods of soil survey and land evaluation are based on transfer by analogy and results can be limited by the quality of the classification system used for mapping. Parametric soil survey is an alternative where predictions of individual soil characteristics and qualities, rather than soil types, are provided for the complete survey area. Predictions can be derived from either local soil classifications or interpolation and surface fitting procedures. The feasibility for a third approach to parametric survey has been investigated using data from the lower Macquarie Valley, NSW, Australia. Soil characteristics were predicted using generalized linear models with more readily observed environmental variables as predictors. These variables (e.g. geomorphic unit, local relief, etc.) are related to pedologic factors controlling soil distribution. A large percentage of variation for most soil characteristics was accounted for by pedoderms which were mapped using stratigraphic relationships determined in the field and by air photo interpretation. (Variation accounted for in the A horizon: clay content = 63.9%, CEC = 66.5%, EC = 26.5%, pH = 43.0%, bulk density = 33.3%, COLE = 61.2%, ?10 kPa gravimetric water content = 66.4%, ?1.5 MPa gravimetric water content = 64.0%; B horizon: clay content = 34.9%, CEC = 58.2%, ESP = 41.5%, EC = 17.2%, pH = 33.3%, bulk density = 32.1%, COLE = 59.9%, ?10 kPa gravimetric water content = 55.5%, ?1.5 MPa gravimetric water content = 39.8%). Within-pedoderm statistical models were developed with landform as an explanatory for several units and these further improved predictions. The potential of the approach in routine soil survey is discussed and the advantages of generalized linear models for analysing survey data are noted.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional and quantitative methods require synthesis for digital soil mapping to reach its full potential, particularly when survey extents are large (i.e. >10,000 km2), data are sparse and resources are limited. One of the challenges is to express narratives of pedogenesis in an explicit form that can be incorporated into digital soil mapping. We present an applied example where such a narrative is developed - it emphasizes landscape history, provenance of soil parent materials and pedogenic process. The narrative is then expressed as rules that are used to produce digital soil maps. The rules are parsimonious; they encourage testing and enable spatial prediction; and are easy to update. The rules rely on just a few terrain and geophysical variables. We demonstrate how a new terrain variable, the multiresolution valley-bottom flatness (MrVBF) index, can be used with the familiar topographic wetness index (TWI), to map geomorphic and soil features.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of this study was to identify and describe soil struc-tural patterns and rooting behavior in reclaimed minesoiis. The soil chosen for this study consists of approximately 0.4 m of topsoil (A horizon) material placed on approximately 1.5 m of 8 blend of B horizon, mixed paleoloesses Sangamon paieosol, and Illinoian till. Four soil pits were excavated, exposing root systems of the corn test crop. Detailed soil and root pattern descriptions were made in each pit. Root patterns were depicted using the profile wall method. An o u t l i n e o f s o i l structural pattern was superimposed over the root pattern to provide a pictorial relationship between the two. Differences in the physical condition of subsoils were distinguished on the basis of the soil descriptions and statistical analysis of the root length determinations. An artificial soil structure was characterized and attributed to particular mining and reclamation practices. The struc- tural arrangement consists of rounded aggregates loosely com- pressed together, that fall within the size classes currently used forblocklike and polyhedral aggregates Plant rooting was distinctly more profuse where this structure was present than where the ssoil material was massive and compact. It is proposed that structural differences among newly constructed soils are of such significance that they should he carefully characterized and described, and what appropriate used for series level separations. Operations using a mining wheel in combination with belt transportation favor tbe formation of the more desirable fritted structure whereas operations using scrapcn exclusively favor the formation of the less desirable massive pbysial condition.},

  Abstract                 = {Rainfall characteristics may determine most of the harmful effects of soil erosion. Intensity variation during a rainfall is one of these important rainfall characteristics. However, there is a lack of information about rainfall patterns that occur in Brazil. This research had as objectives the determination of natural erosive rainfalls patterns verified in Santa Maria (RS), and the estimation of rainfall return period for the three patterns proposed. Daily rainfall charts were obtained from the Research Center of Forestry and Soil Conservation, of FEPAGRO, from 1963 to 1989 and from 1991 to 1992. Rainfalls were classified in advanced, intermediary and delayed patterns, according to their maximum intensity peak position and afterwards, the rainfall return period for each rainfall pattern was estimated. Some interesting characteristics were calculated, such as the mean intensity peaks, duration of rainfalls and peaks with intensity over 100 mm h-1. Out of the 1193 natural erosive rainfalls analyzed, the advanced, intermediary and delayed patterns had 551, 295 and 347 rainfalls, corresponding to 46,2; 24,7 and 29,1% of the total number of rainfalls, respectively. This characterizes the advanced pattern as the most frequent rainfall pattern in Santa Maria. From the 79 rainfalls with intensity peak greater than 100 mm h-1, the advanced, intermediary and delayed pattern had 45, 18 and 16 rainfalls, corresponding to 8,2; 6,1 and 4,6% ofthe total number of rain falls. The mean duration of rain falls with peaks greater than 100 mm h-1 was of 8 hours, and mean peak duration was 6 minutes and 50 seconds. For the estimation of return periods, the maximum rainfall amount in 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 480 minutes during the 29 years studied were identified, for the three rainfall patterns defined before. The maximum intensity values found for the specified duration were submitted to a computer program, and the extreme distribution type I had the best fit to the data. The return periods of 2, 5, 10, 20 50 and 100 years for the studied rainfall duration were calculated and intensity-duration-frequency curves were built for the three above-mentioned rainfall patterns.},

  Abstract                 = {The oxidation potential of dithionite (NaS204) increases from 0.37 V to 0.73 V with increase in pH from 6 to 9, because hydroxyl is consumed during oxidation of dithionite. At the same time the amount of iron oxide dissolved in 15 minutes falls off (from 100 percent to less than 1 per cent extracted) with increase in pH from 6 to 12 owing to solubility product relationships of iron oxides. An optimum pH for maximum reaction kinetics occurs at approximately pH 7.3. A buffer is needed to hold the pH at the optimum level because 4 moles of OH are used up in reaction with each mole of Na2S204 oxidized. Tests show that NaHCO3 effectively serves as a buffer in this application. Crystalline hematite dissolved in amounts of several hundred milligrams in 2 min. Crystalline goethite dissolved more slowly, but dissolved during the two or three 15 rain treatments normally given for iron oxide removal from soils and clays. A series of methods for the extraction of iron oxides from soils and clays was tested with soils high in free iron oxides and with nontronite and other iron-bearing clays. It was found that the bicarbonate-buffered Na2S2Oa-citrate system was the most effective in removal of free iron oxides from latosolic soils, and the least destructive of iron silicate clays as indicated by least loss in cation exchange capacity after the iron oxide removal treatment . With soils the decrease was very little but with the very susceptible Woody district nontronite , the decrease was about 17 percent as contrasted to 35-80 percent with other methods.},

O solo da área, localizado em Monte Alto, SP, foi classificado como Argissolo Vermelho Amarelo (PVA), relevo ondulado e sob diferentes manejos. O solo da área localizado em Jaboticabal, SP, foi classificado como Latossolo Vermelho (LV), relevo suave, cultivado com cana-de-açúcar. O esquema de amostragem constituiu em uma malha irregular. Amostras de solo foram obtidas na profundidade de 0-0,2 m, para cada malha: 88 amostras para a área de Monte Alto (1465 ha) e 128 amostras para a área de Jaboticabal (2597 ha). Para obtenção dos valores das variáveis estudadas, empregou-se a EUPS para cada ponto amostrado. Os dados foram submetidos à análise estatística descritiva e geoestatística para definição dos semivariogramas. Para os modelos foi utilizada a interpolação por krigagem. Observou- se a ocorrência de dependência espacial para todas as variáveis. O solo PVA apresentou maiores riscos de erosão, devi- do ao relevo, uso atual e manejo, comparado com o solo LV.},

  Abstract                 = {Existem poucos estudos sobre os solos sob cultivo de subsistência em assentamentos rurais do norte da Amazônia. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram a caracterização de solos da Colônia Agrícola do Apiaú, Roraima, e a avaliação das alterações em algumas propriedades químicas resultantes dos sistemas de manejo adotados pelos agricultores, bem como os impactos da ação de queimadas nos solos. As áreas estudadas foram: pastagens, cultivo de banana e de milho, mata queimada e não queimada. As amostras de solos foram submetidas a análises químicas e mineralógicas. Foram encontrados Latossolos, Argissolos e Gleissolos, todos possuindo mineralogia caulinítica e expressivos teores de Ti, evidenciando elevado grau de intemperismo. Os Argissolos e Gleissolos possuem baixos teores de Fe. Os baixos teores de cátions trocáveis indicam a baixa fertilidade natural, com elevada saturação por Al no complexo sortivo na maioria dos solos. A pobreza química resultou em pouca variação química entre os diferentes solos. Comparativamente, a área cultivada com banana mostrou os maiores teores de cátions trocáveis e de P disponível no horizonte superficial, conseqüência da mineralização dos restos culturais pela ação do fogo e maior proximidade de afloramentos de rocha. A pobreza química extrema nos Argissolos refletiu-se na má qualidade da pastagem degradada. Os baixos teores totais de Zn, Cu e Mg indicaram sua baixa reserva e possível deficiência.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of soil attributes and soil classes in digital soil mapping relies on finding relationships between soil and the predictor variables of soil-forming factors and processes. The predictor variables can be remotely or proximally sensed images of soil, landscape, parent material or climatic factors. Till date, most prediction methods are based on performing regression on the predictor variables directly to predict soil attributes or classes. There are problems using data layers from different sources, particularly, multicollinearity, and the fact that the relationships between soil and environmental variables can change with spatial scale. To overcome the problem of correlation between variables, principal component analysis can be performed on the predictor variables. With respect to the spatial dependency, each of these variables can be decomposed into separate spatial components and mapped separately. One of the methods of achieving this is wavelet analysis, which decomposes the variables into separate hierarchical spatial components of decreasing spatial resolution. These components could all be derived and subsequently used as separate layers in predicting soil classes or soil attributes. In this chapter, data are decomposed using the wavelet method and examples of predictions of soil classes and surface-clay content are shown, in order to evaluate the effect of using the decomposed layers in comparison with the original data.},

  Abstract                 = {In this chapter, we shall discuss about the state of the art of the Brazilian soil survey and mapping, including a brief history of soil surveys in Brazil, a summary description of survey methods and techniques, mapping paradigms, as well as the present-day needs and current challenges. Digital soil mapping is viewed as an opportunity to recover the unaccomplished soil mapping program in Brazil. We also focus on several attempts to make a national soil database, starting at the beginning of the 1980s with SisSolos, followed by SigSolos, and lately, SigWeb “Iniciativa Solos br”, available at http://www.cnps.embrapa.br/soilsbr and the country's new challenges to improve soil mapping, as well as some insights into digital soil mapping. Traditional soil surveys in Brazil have covered almost the whole country; these soil surveys are mainly in small-scale mapping, except for the Amazon region, which is poorly provided with soil surveys. Four main governmental institutions, Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation (EMBRAPA), Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE), Agronomic Institute of Campinas (IAC) and Geological Survey of Brazil (CPRM), execute soil surveys at the national and state levels. Private consultants also perform soil surveys, particularly on larger scales, under private contracts. Consequently, there is much dispersed information about soil surveys, but at least the methods and procedures are kept reasonably uniform all over the country. The systematic, governmental-supported soil mapping of the entire country, as initially planned, has been cancelled for a long time, although the demand for soil survey information continues at the same or even higher levels in some regions. At present, complete soil mapping covers 17 states out of 26, and the Federal District, at scales ranging from 1:100,000 to 1:600,000, covers approximately 35% of Brazilian soil, as well as a full uniform cover at scales of 1:1,000,000 and 1:5,000,000. Extensive zones still lack complete soil information at suitable scales and survey levels, needed to face the current problems of use, management, conservation, prevention and recovery of agriculturally and nonagriculturally degraded areas. Nowadays, soil surveys are made only on governmental demands, to support agroecological zonings and evaluation of environmental-impact projects, precision agriculture, degraded-area reclamation, planning of rural settlements and land-use planning, and are always linked to multidisciplinary activities. Soil and environmental data organisation, structuring and availability is imperative to perform digital soil mapping, which will certainly generate demands of quality databases as well as of the necessary tools for institutions involved in soil surveys in Brazil. },

A rigor, ele mostrou que o progresso ocorre em duas direções diferentes e complementares. Isso o levou a advogar a tese de que o desenvolvimento da ciência se dá por intermédio de uma tensão essencial entre o normal e o revolucionário. Segundo Kuhn, há o progresso no sentido de aprofundamento do conhecimento – proporcionado pela aquisição de um paradigma – e há o progresso no sentido de ampliação do conhecimento – gerado pela emergência da incomensurabilidade. O argumento central que desenvolvemos, neste artigo, afirma que o problema de Kuhn foi ter começado, com o passar do tempo, a pensar esses dois conceitos fundamentais (paradigma e incomensurabilidade) somente em suas conotações lingüísticas e teóricas.},

The materials were characterized by means of XRD, FTIR, SEM and TEM before and after leaching with disodium peroxodisulphate. Systematic experiments were conducted to determine the effects of leaching on the chemical and isotopic composition of oxygen, hydrogen and K-Ar in these samples. Effects on the physicochemical properties of the clays such as BET external surface area, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and expandability with ethylene glycol were also investigated. The results show that structure, chemical composition, oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios, as well as the K-Ar system remain unaffected by leaching with disodium peroxodisulphate. The CEC and expandability remain unchanged, whereas changes in BET area can be attributed to mechanical dispersion by ultrasonic treatment.},

  Abstract                 = {This article describes some of the results of a land evaluation within the framework of a research project carried out in a small catchment on the Loess Plateau in northern China, which has long been exposed to land degradation from erosion. The project aimed to identify an approach for land use planning, combining participatory (land users) planning, land evaluation and soil erosion modelling. The results from this study were intended to provide the biophysical properties of importance to be used together with results from participatory approach (PA) studies and soil erosion modelling to construct scenarios for a more sustainable use of land. Land properties, which were restricting for agricultural cropping, were defined and values of each property were matched with the requirements for cropping. By defining the spatial distribution of critical properties, they could be combined to achieve compound suitability classes in each land unit for the chosen land use. Information was gathered from measurements and data searches as well as from farmers, using PA methods. Properties for which data and other information were available and which were considered to be relevant for the study included climate, soil water content, slope aspect, soil water storage capacity, rooting environment, tillage constraints, slope gradient, infiltration capacity, soil nutrients and flooding hazard. Each of the properties were discussed in relation to their influence on land suitability, primarily for agricultural crops. Whatever management changes were carried out to improve the productivity and sustainability in the project catchment, restrictions for agricultural production were large. The major constraints were water availability, nutrient availability and erosion hazard. The properties chosen for further use in suitability evaluation and scenario analyses were those having a significant spatial variability in the catchment: soil type, slope gradient and slope aspect. The results from this study are applied in other articles this issue.},

  Abstract                 = {Terrestrial ecosystems provide a number of vital services for people and society, such as biodiversity, food, fibre, water resources, carbon sequestration, and recreation. The future capability of ecosystems to provide these services is determined by changes in socio-economic characteristics, land use, biodiversity, atmospheric composition and climate. Most published impact assessments do not address the vulnerability of the human-environment system under such environmental change. They cannot answer important multidisciplinary policy relevant questions such as: which are the main regions or sectors that are vulnerable to global change? How do the vulnerabilities of two regions compare? Which scenario is the least, or most, harmful for a given region or sector? The ATEAM project (Advanced Terrestrial Ecosystem Analysis and Modelling) uses a new approach to ecosystem assessment by integrating the potential impacts in a vulnerability assessment, which can help answer multidisciplinary questions, such as those listed above. This paper presents the vulnerability assessment of the ATEAM land use scenarios. The 14 land use types, discussed in detail by Rounsevell et al. (this volume), can be related to a range of ecosystem services. For instance, forest area is associated with wood production and designated land with outdoor recreation. Directly applying the vulnerability methodology to the land use change scenarios helps in understanding land use change impacts across the European environment. Scatter plots summarising impacts per principal European Environmental Zone (EnZ) help in interpreting how the impacts of the scenarios differ between ecosystem services and the European environments. While there is considerable heterogeneity in both the potential impacts of global changes, and the adaptive capacity to cope with these impacts, this assessment shows that southern Europe in particular will be vulnerable to land use change. Projected economic growth increases adaptive capacity, but is also associated with the most negative potential impacts. The potential impacts of more environmentally oriented developments are smaller, indicating an important role for both policy and society in determining eventual residual impacts.},

Several classes of contamination were found, including tail weights from the uniform to the double exponential, exponential-level asymmetry, severe digit preferences, multimodalities, and modes external to the mean/median interval. Thus, the underlying tenets of normality-assuming statistics appear fallacious for these commonly used types of data. However, findings here also fail to support the types of distributions used in most prior robustness research suggesting the failure of such statistics under nonnormal conditions. A reevaluation of the statistical robustness literature appears appropriate in light of these findings.},

  Abstract                 = {The river catchment Vacacaí Mirim is located where the water reservoir that supplies part of the water needs of the city of Santa Maria is located in a hillslope area of plateau border Southern Rio Grande. In these hillslope areas, due to the combination of strong relief is rolling to hilly common occurrence of soils with variable depth, with the predominance of shallow soils. The objectives were to conduct a study ofcurrent use and the evolution of land use and demarcation of areas of risk or potentially susceptible to loss of soil from the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). The soil survey of semi-detailed, characterize thedifferent soil classes occurring in the region. Through techniques of GIS maps were generated from soil, slope, Permanent Preservation Areas (PPAs), land suitability and land use evolution from 1987 to 2009. Map was made usability and identified areas of land use conflicts. According to the soil survey over 50% of the area consists of Entisols and over 50% of the area has less ability, being only suitable for the protection offauna and flora. For the second study, the topographic factor (LS) was generated from the digital elevation model (DEM), the rainfall-runoff erosivity factor (R) data through normal rainfall, erodibility factor (K) thecomposition particle size of each class of soil, and cover-management and support practice factor (CP) through field observations and tabulated values. About 74% of the area has soil losses ranging 1 to 2 tha-1 .yr -1 . Only 3% of the area has a soil loss of more than 20 t ha -1 .yr -1 , and of these 3%, 1% shows soil loss exceeding 50 t ha -1 .yr -1 . For assessing the potential loss of soil, the topographic factor (LS) was the most strongly determined the pace of erosion followed by the factor use and cover-management and support practice factor (CP) and soil erodibility factor (K). The aid of the image ofcomputer application Google Earth is a very important tool in the evaluation of occupation and land use in the study area. The data gathered through this methodology for the estimation of factor use and cover-management and support practice factor (CP) are reliable and the researcher can make a conference field for a possible better definition of the classes of land use.},

Gerou-se o mapa de solos e o mapa de aptidão agrícola das terras e utilizando técnicas de geoprocessamento foram gerados mapas de declividade, áreas de preservação permanente (APPs) e evolução de uso das terras de 1987 a 2009. O levantamento de solo mostrou predomínio de Neossolos Litólicos (50% da área), seguido de Argissolos Bruno-Acinzentados (14%) associação de Cambissolos-Neossolos (14%), Argissolos Vermelhos (12%) e pequenas áreas com Planossolos Háplicos e associações de Neossolos Litólicos e Neossolos Regolíticos. Mais de 50% da área não apresenta aptidão para lavouras com cultivos anuais de grãos, pastagens plantadas ou áreas de reflorestamento, sendo somente indicada para a preservação da fauna e da flora. As APPs correspondem a 14% da área total de estudo. A evolução de uso da terra na bacia hidrográfica, no período estudado mostra que nesses últimos 22 anos houve um aumento das áreas de floresta com uma possível estabilização do ambiente a partir do ano de 1991 e um decréscimo considerável nas áreas de lavoura.

  Abstract                 = {Minerals with less than perfect crystallinity (poorly crystalline minerals) are ubiquitous in pedogenetic active soils as a result of mineral weathering. However, systematic investigations into the importance of poorly crystalline phases for carbon stabilisation in soils are scarce. We used clay subfractions from 12 acid subsoil horizons of differing pedogenetic provenance to test the influence of poorly crystalline minerals on carbon stabilisation. Stable organic carbon (OC stable ) was isolated by chemical treatment using NaOCl. Poorly crystalline minerals were characterised chemically by selective dissolution with acid oxalate and dithionite?citrate and physically by surface area determinations (BET?N 2 ). Fine clay contained slightly but insignificantly more stable OC and total N than coarse clay fractions. The majority of the variability of stable OC concentrations (r 2 =0.58, pb0.01 in coarse and r 2 =0.84, pb0.001 in fine clay) was explained by linear regression using a parameter, which represents poorly crystalline Fe and Al minerals [OC stable =f(Fe+Al) o ]. Stable OC was neither related to dithionite-extractable Fe (Fe d ) nor to mineral surface area. The absence of a relation between stable OC and total mineral surface area points to a coupling mechanism requiring specific surface sites on mineral surfaces.},

  Abstract                 = {We compare the performance of three most accepted reagents for organic matter removal: hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) and disodium peroxodisulfate (Na2S2O8). Removal of organic matter from soil is mostly incomplete with the efficiency of removal depending on reaction conditions and sample properties. Generally, NaOCl and Na2S2O8 are more effective in organic C removal than H2O2. Alkaline conditions and additives favoring dispersion and/or desorption of organic matter, such as sodium pyrophosphate, seem to be crucial for C removal. Pyrophosphate and additives for pH control (bicarbonate) may irreversibly adsorb to mineral surfaces. In soils with a large proportion of organic matter bound to the mineral matrix, for example subsoils, or rich in clay-sized minerals (Fe oxides, poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases, expandable phyllosilicates), C removal can be little irrespective of the reagents used. Residual organic C seems to seems to represent largely refractory organic matter, and comprises mainly pyrogenic materials and aliphatic compounds. If protected by close association with minerals, other organic constituents such as low-molecular weight carboxylicacids, lignin-derived and N-containing compounds may escape chemical destruction. For determination of mineral phase properties, treatment with H2O2 should be avoided since it may promote organicassisted dissolution of poorly crystalline minerals at low pH, disintegration of expandable clay minerals, and transformation of vermiculite into mica-like products due to NH4  fixation. Sodium hypochlorite and Na2S2O8 are less harmful for minerals thanH2O2.While the NaOCl procedure (pH 9.5) may dissolve Al hydroxides, alkaline conditions favor the precipitation of metals released upon destruction of organic matter. Prolonged heating to 40C during any treatment may transform poorly crystalline minerals into more crystalline ones. Sodium hypochlorite can be used at 25C, thus preventing heat-induced mineral alteration.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic matter (OM) can be stabilized against decomposition by association with minerals, by its inherent recalcitrance and by occlusion in aggregates. However, the relative contribution of these factors to OM stabilization is yet unknown. We analyzed pool size and isotopic composition (14C, 13C) of mineral-protected and recalcitrant OM in 12 subsurface horizons from 10 acidic forest soils. The results were related to properties of the mineral phase and to OM composition as revealed by CPMAS 13C-NMR and CuO oxidation. Stable OM was defined as that material which survived treatment of soils with 6 wt% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl). Mineral-protected OM was extracted by subsequent dissolution of minerals by 10% hydrofluoric acid (HF). Organic matter resistant against NaOCl and insoluble in HF was considered as recalcitrant OM. Hypochlorite removed primarily 14C-modern OM. Of the stable organic carbon (OC), amounting to 2.4?20.6 g kg?1 soil, mineral dissolution released on average 73%. Poorly crystalline Fe and Al phases (Feo, Alo) and crystalline Fe oxides (Fed?o) explained 86% of the variability of mineral-protected OC. Atomic Cp/(Fe+Al)p ratios of 1.3?6.5 suggest that a portion of stable OM was associated with polymeric Fe and Al species. Recalcitrant OC (0.4?6.5 g kg?1 soil) contributed on average 27% to stable OC and the amount was not correlated with any mineralogical property. Recalcitrant OC had lower ?14C and ?13C values than mineral-protected OC and was mainly composed of aliphatic (56%) and O-alkyl (13%) C moieties. Lignin phenols were only present in small amounts in either mineral-protected or recalcitrant OM (mean 4.3 and 0.2 g kg?1 OC). The results confirm that stabilization of OM by interaction with poorly crystalline minerals and polymeric metal species is the most important mechanism for preservation of OM in these acid subsoil horizons.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil conservation in South Africa has historically focused on preventing soil erosion. Effective maintenance of the soil requires, in addition to erosion control, an understanding of how land-use practices affect more subtle indicators of soil quality. This review outlines how land use in South Africa can rapidly result in a marked reduction in soil organic matter (SOM) content and increased tendency of soils to crust. Removal of a cover of vegetation, whether by ploughing, grazing or burning, tends to reduce SOM due to reduced inputs of organic matter and enhanced activity of soil microbes. Loss of SOM, particularly from the top few centimetres of soil (named here the pedoderm), has a dispropor- tionately large effect on soil infiltrability and nutrient supply. The mineralogy of the clay fraction also has great bearing on the response of soil to land-use effects. The unexpected role of quartz in soil dispersion and crusting in South Africa has only recently been revealed. Apart from SOM effects, land use can lead to subtle changes in soil chemistry. Plantation forestry has resulted in an increase in soil nitrate in many areas, possibly due to greater mineralization under forests than grasslands. Annual burning in the Kruger National Park bushveld has been shown to increase clay dispersibility and crusting of the pedoderm, which was ascribed to a reduction in electrical conductivity and SOM as well as to an increase in the exchangeable sodium percentage. Soil quality is a multifaceted concept. One aspect stands out, however, as critical and that is the conservation and replenishment of nitrogen, which is all-important for retaining humus and maintaining soil quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Gilgais form repeating patterns that seem to be regular to some degree. We have analysed the patterns of gilgais as they appear on aerial photographs of the Bland Plain of New South Wales to discover to what degree they exhibit regularity and to estimate the spatial frequencies of the repeating patterns. We digitised rectangular sections of the photographs to produce grids of pixels at 0.063-mm intervals, equivalent to 1.3 m on the ground, with the optical density of each pixel recorded as a level of grey in the range 0 (black) to 255 (white). From the data we computed autocorrelograms and power spectra in both 1 and 2 dimensions and wavelet coefficients and wavelet packet coefficients and their variances. Spectra of many of the individual rows of the grids contained peaks corresponding to wavelengths of ≈32 m (at Caragabal) and ≈52 m (at Back Creek). The 2-dimensional spectra have rings of relatively large power corresponding to these wavelengths in addition to their central peaks. The 1-dimensional wavelet variances have pronounced peaks at the 16-32 pixel scale, corresponding to 20-40 m on the ground. The 2-dimensional wavelet analyses revealed peaks in the variances in the same range. Back Creek has in addition a low-frequency feature caused by the much darker than average gilgais in one comer of the digitised rectangle, and this is equally evident in the 1-dimensional analyses of rows that cross this comer, where the largest contribution to wavelet packet variation is at wavelength 84-167 m. Where this feature is absent, the best wavelet packet basis indicates that variation at frequencies at or below the repeating pattern is consistent with an underlying stationary random variable, while higher-frequency components show more complex (non-stationary) behaviour. We conclude that the gilgai patterns we have examined have a regularity with wavelengths in the range 30-50 m.},

  Abstract                 = {National and sub-national scale estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and changes can provide information land degradation risk, C sequestration possibilities and the potential sustainability of proposed land management plans. Under a GEF co-financed project, ?The GEFSOC Modelling System? was used to determine SOC stocks and projected stock change rates for four case study areas; The Brazilian Amazon, The Indo-Gangetic Plains of India, Kenya and Jordan. Each case study represented soil and vegetation types, climates and land management systems that are under represented globally, in terms of an understanding of land use and land management systems and the effects these systems have on SOC stocks. The stocks and stock change rates produced were based on detailed geo-referenced datasets of soils, climate, land use and management information. These datasets are unique as they bring together national and regional scale data on the main variables determining SOC, for four contrasting non-temperate eco-regions. They are also unique, as they include information on land management practices used in subsistence agriculture in tropical and arid areas. Implications of a greater understanding of SOC stocks and stock change rates in non-temperate areas are considered. Relevance to national land use plans are explored for each of the four case studies, in terms of sustainability, land degradation and greenhouse gas mitigation potential. Ways in which such information will aid the case study countries in fulfilling obligations under the United Nations Conventions on Climate Change, Biodiversity and Land Degradation are also considered. The need for more detailed land management data to improve SOC stock estimates in non-temperate areas is discussed.},

It is there- fore assumed that stabilization reactions exist, which may be related to the presence. of particular mineral compounds in soils. An incubation experiment was made to investigate the influence of selected oxides (ferrihydrite, aluminium hydroxide, birnessite) on the decomposition of polysaccharides in beech litter. pH changes and the dynamics of total organic carbon, cellulosic and non-cellulosic polysacchar- ides, and potential cellulase activity were recorded. Carbon loss during incubation was promoted by 10% in the presence of birnessite, which acts as an oxidizing agent. Polysaccharide decomposition was hardly affected by birnessite. On the other hand, ferrihydrite and aluminium hydroxide reduced the de- composition of bulk organic matter by 12 and 65%, respectively. These mineral phases resulted in a re- duction of carbohydrate decomposition by 15 and 50%, respectively. In the presence of aluminium hydroxide, there was no significant cellulose decomposition after 90 d. Nevertheless, throughout the ex- periment, potential cellulase activity was higher in this treatment than in the presence of bimessite. Therefore we assume that organic matter stabilization is caused by toxic effects, or by adsorption to the oxides or hydroxides, especially to aluminium hydroxide, or by both. This process tends to lower the microbial availability of organic matter and therefore to inhibit the decomposition.},

  Abstract                 = {Prediction of soil attributes (properties and classes) in digital soil mapping (DSM) is based on the correlation between primary soil attributes and secondary environmental attributes. These secondary attributes can be obtained relatively cheaply over large areas. In the presence of these environmental covariates, a strategic sampling design needs to ensure the coverage of the full range of environmental variables. This could enhance the full representation of the expected soil properties or soil classes. This chapter presents the Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) as a sampling strategy on existing data layers. LHS is a stratified-random procedure that provides an efficient way of sampling variables from their multivariate distributions. It provides a full coverage of the range of each variable by maximally stratifying the marginal distribution. This method is illustrated with examples from DSM of part of the Hunter Valley of New South Wales. Comparison is made with other methods: random sampling, equal spatial strata and principal component (PC). Results showed that the LHS is the most effective way to replicate the distribution of the variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial prediction with the presence of spatially dense ancillary variables has attracted research in pedometrics. While soil survey and analysis of soil properties are still expensive and time consuming, the secondary data can be made available on a dense grid for the whole area of interest. The main aim of using the ancillary data is to enhance prediction of soil properties by making use of the ancillary variables as covariates. Methods that can be used for this purpose are kriging with external drift, cokriging, regression kriging, and REML-EBLUP (Residual Maximum Likelihood-Empirical Best Linear Unbiased Predictor). Regression kriging is a sub-optimal method that has been utilised extensively because it is easy to use and has been shown empirically to perform as well as other methods. A statically sound method is REML-EBLUP. This paper examines the use of REML-EBLUP in combination with the Matérn covariance function for spatial prediction of soil properties. Methods for estimating parameters of the Matérn variogram using REML, and prediction with EBLUP are described. The prediction capability of REML-EBLUP, regression kriging, and ordinary kriging is compared for four datasets. Results show that although REML-EBLUP generally improves the prediction, the improvement is small compared with regression kriging. Thus, for practical applications regression kriging appears to be a robust method. REML-EBLUP is useful when the trend is strong, and the number of observations is small (&lt;&#xa0;200). We concluded that improvement in the prediction of soil properties does not rely on more sophisticated statistical methods, but rather on gathering more useful and higher quality data.},

Based on dominant identifiers in the WRB soil groups, taxonomic distances were derived between the soil groups and plotted in feature space. Using this information the soil's mean taxonomic distance for the world was calculated. The mean taxonomic distance combines the abundance and taxonomic relationship between soil groups and appears to be a useful index of pedodiversity. There is a good relation between mean taxonomic distance and climate or soil classes; areas with extreme temperatures and precipitation have the lowest pedodiversity. It was observed that areas with more detailed soil mapping units exhibit the largest pedodiversity and it was concluded that the measure of pedodiversity depends amongst others on the detail of the soil survey in an area.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimation and mapping carbon storage in the soil is currently an important topic; thus, the knowledge of the distribution of carbon content with depth is essential. This paper examines the use of a negative exponential profile depth function to describe the soil carbon data at different depths, and its integral to represent the carbon storage. A novel method is then proposed for mapping the soil carbon storage in the Lower Namoi Valley, NSW. This involves deriving pedotransfer functions to predict soil organic carbon and bulk density, fitting the exponential depth function to the carbon profile data, deriving a neural network model to predict parameters of the exponential function from environmental data, and mapping the organic carbon storage. The exponential depth function is shown to fit the soil carbon data adequately, and the parameters also reflect the influence of soil order. The parameters of the exponential depth function were predicted from land use, radiometric K, and terrain attributes. Using the estimated parameters we map the carbon storage of the area from surface to a depth of 1 m. The organic carbon storage map shows the high influence of land use on the predicted storage. Values of 15?22 kg/m2 were predicted for the forested area and 2?6 kg/m2 in the cultivated area in the plains.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial sampling schemes are mainly developed to determine sampling locations that can cover the variation of environmental properties in the area of interest. Here we proposed the variance quadtree algorithm for sampling in an area with prior information represented as ancillary or secondary environmental data, and the covariance structure of the ancillary variable is non-stationary. The algorithm is based on the idea of a quadtree decomposition, where an area is successively divided into strata so each stratum has more-or-less equal variation. An observation point is then placed inside each stratum. This scheme samples sparsely in relatively uniform areas and more intensively where variation is large. It samples in the feature space and also takes into consideration the spread in the geographic space. We describe the algorithm, its software implementation, and present some examples of applications.},

These procedures are based on equations traditionally used to determine the LS factor and information that characterize the hillslope forms and processes, derived from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Two computational methods commonly used to calculate LS factor in soil erosion and sediment yield models were analyzed in this study. The analysis was performed in four small rural watersheds with hilly terrain. The LS values obtained by the methods of spatial representation were compared with each other with LS values measured by the traditional method. Results show significant differences of the computer- generated LS values, which were related to the calculation procedure and the method used to determine the DEM flow direction. Differences were also observed between the numeric values of the LS factor determined by methods of spatial representation and in the field.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil physical and chemical characteristics as well as climatic and geomorphological factors have been determined in 68 sites of a mountain calcimorphic ecosystem (Sierra María-Los Vélez Natural Park, Almería) in Southeastern Spain. Land use and vegetation were natural pine forest, evergreen oak forest, reforested pine forest of different ages, bush, juniper forest, and olive, almond and cereal crops under conventional tillage. By using multivariate data treatments, 17 soil variables were processed. A large part of the total variability was controlled by local topographical features through their effect on moisture retention and vegetation. Most characteristics were significantly correlated with total organic C (mean = 28.5 ± 4.6 g kg? 1), which demonstrates the central role of the organic matter in the functioning of the whole ecosystem. New soil quality descriptors consisting of ratios to soil organic carbon were obtained, informing about the specific activity (per C unit) or performance of the organic matter, independently of its total content. When soil data are directly processed by using principal component analysis, we found a set of high quality soils under natural and old reforested forests, where environmental services provided by soil depend on the high levels of quality descriptors related to organic carbon, e.g. cation exchange capacity (CEC), total porosity, or aggregate stability. When variables such as CEC, porosity and aggregate stability are calculated as ratios to the total organic carbon, a new classification pattern is obtained, allowing to detect soils with organic matter of high maturity which in general do not coincide with soils with high organic matter content. The results suggest the assessment of soil quality based on ratios informing on the organic matter performance should be emphasized as an alternative to direct descriptors based on the total organic carbon content.},

A natureza química das substâncias húmicas (SHs) reflete os processos de gênese e uso do solo e pode ser usada como indicador da qualidade da MO. O objetivo deste estudo foi usar a qualidade da MO como sinalizador do ambiente edáfico em áreas de mata nativa, sobre Gleissolo Háplico Tb distrófico, argissólico e Cambissolo Háplico Tb distrófico, e em plantios abandonados de eucalipto de diferentes idades, sobre Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo distrófico latossólico, localizados na Reserva Biológica União, RJ. Para isso, foram avaliadas as distribuições da MO humificada e os ácidos húmicos do solo por meio de métodos químicos e espectroscópicos, em duas profundidades do solo (0?0,10 e 0,10?0,20 m). Os solos da Reserva Biológica apresentaram fertilidade natural muito baixa, condição esta limitante para o processo de humificação. As SHs representaram, portanto, menos de 50 % do carbono prontamente oxidável, indicando que as substâncias não-húmicas compõem a maior parte da MO; portanto, a serrapilheira tem o papel central na nutrição das plantas e microrganismos. A distribuição relativa das frações que compõem a MO humificada não foi alterada pela cobertura vegetal nem pela classe de solo. Os ácidos húmicos apresentaram natureza química semelhante à normalmente encontrada para os ácidos fúlvicos, e tais características foram expressas no baixo conteúdo de C e nos elevados valores das razões H/C e O/C e da acidez, o que levou à formação de material humificado pouco condensado. A espectroscopia de infravermelho indicou o efeito do tipo de solo e da cobertura vegetal sobre a qualidade química dos ácidos húmicos. O material humificado isolado da Mata Atlântica apresentou maior intensidade de fluorescência, sugerindo maior labilidade e capacidade de ceder elétrons para reações químicas do solo.},

  Abstract                 = {Landforms and landscape context are of particular importance in understanding the processes of soil genesis and soil formation in the spatial domain. Consequently, many approaches for soil generation are based on classifications of commonly available digital elevation models (DEM). However, their application is often restricted by the lack of transferability to other, more hetero- geneous, landscapes. Part of the problem is the lack of broadly accepted definitions of topo- graphic location based on landscape context. These issues arise because of: (1) the scale dependencies of landscape pattern and processes, (2) different DEM qualities, and (3) different expert perceptions. To address these problems, we suggest a hierarchical terrain-classification procedure for defining landscape context. The classification algorithm described in this paper handles object detection and classification separately. Landscape objects are defined at multiple scales using a region-based segmentation algorithm which allows each object to be placed into a hierarchical landscape context. The classification is carried out using the terrain attribute mass-balance index across a range of scales. Soil genesis and transport processes at estab- lished field sites were used to guide the classification process. The method was tested in Sax- ony-Anhalt (Germany), an area that contains heterogeneous land surfaces and soil substrates. The resulting maps represent adaptation degrees between classifications and 191 semantically identified random samples. The map with the best adaptation has an overall accuracy of 89%.},

Foi coletada amostra de solo em malha na profundidade de 0,00-0,50m, realizando-se análise química de cada ponto amostrado. Os maiores coeficientes de variação e alcances foram observados na pedoforma convexa (Latossolo). Portanto, o Latossolo inserido na pedoforma convexa apresentou maior variabilidade espacial para os atributos químicos em relação ao Argissolo na pedoforma linear. O latossolo inserido pedoforma convexa necessita de maior número de pontos de coleta por apresentar maior variabilidade espacial. Recomenda-se que o intervalo de amostragem seja igual ao alcance da dependência espacial, para associar menor esforço de amostragem com maior representatividade.},

According to the authors, compound attributes involve combinations of the primary attributes and are indices that describe or characterize the spatial variability of specific processes occurring in the landscape such as soil water content distribution or the potential for sheet erosion. But are the "soil water content distribution" or the "potential for sheet erosion" processes or features of the land surface? The authors also suggest that the compound indices can be used as surrogates of very complex hydrological, geomorphological, and biological processes. They suggest the use of the wetness and radiation indices to predict the spatial distribution of different plant species. I understand that using these DEM derivaties as predictor variables does not mean that the are surrogates of the processes, but instead they are descriptions of the land surface with are correlated with the spatial distribution of different plant species.},

  Abstract                 = {In response to the need for a simple atmospheric correction method and the consequent verification of such a method, an experiment was conducted to acquire a data set suitable for testing atmospheric correction procedures under a variety of atmospheric conditions. Several procedures, including radiative transfer codes (RTCs) with simulated atmospheres, image-based procedures and dark-object subtraction (DOS), were evaluated by comparing surface reflectance factors derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) digital data with low-altitude, aircraft-based measurements for seven dates over a 1-year period. Acceptable results, approximately ± 0.02 reflectance (1 σ RMS), were achieved based on an \{RTC\} with appropriate simulated atmospheres. The \{DOS\} technique was the least accurate method and, in fact, produced greater error in estimations of near-IR reflectance than no correction at all. Two hybrid approaches, which combined the image-based nature of \{DOS\} with the precision of an RTC, provided sufficient accuracy and simplicity to warrant consideration for use on an operational basis. Though these results were probably site-specific (characterized by relatively low aerosol levels and low humidity), they illustrate the feasibility of simple atmospheric correction methods and the usefulness of a diverse data set for validation of such techniques. },

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping techniques appear to be an interesting alternative for traditional soil survey techniques. However, most applications deal with (semi-)detailed soil surveys where soil variability is determined by a limited number of soil forming factors. The question that remains is whether digital soil mapping techniques are equally suitable for exploratory or reconnaissance soil surveys in more extensive areas with limited data availability. We applied digital soil mapping in a 13,500 km2 study area in Kenya with the main aim to create a reconnaissance soil map to assess clay and soil organic carbon contents in terraced maize fields. Soil spatial variability prediction was based on environmental correlation using the concepts of the soil forming factors equation. During field work, 95 composite soil samples were collected. Auxiliary spatially exhaustive data provided insight on the spatial variation of climate, land cover, topography and parent material. The final digital soil maps were elaborated using regression kriging. The variance explained by the regression kriging models was estimated as 13% and 37% for soil organic carbon and clay respectively. These results were confirmed by cross-validation and provide a significant improvement compared to the existing soil survey.},

The reforested clearings were set up in 2003, 2002, 2001, 1999 and 1993, with native regional species. The soil fertility was associated to soil organic matter content. The reforestation increased significantly the organic matter and the microbial biomass after the fourth year, and this indicates the need of an initial soil supply of carbon content, which can be provided by grasses or legumes used for forage.},

  Abstract                 = {An accurate estimate of the organic carbon stock in the soil in a country allows the global estimate to be refined. This study estimated the organic carbon stock in forest soil in Japan using available data. Forest soil was classified into 15 soil units, and the extent of each soil unit was determined using digital soil and land use data. A representative value of the organic carbon density for each unit was determined from 3391 soil profiles obtained in a nationwide soil survey. The mean organic carbon density of the forest soils differed in each soil unit; the density to a depth of 1 m ranged from 33.0 kg m 2 for Black soils (Andisols) to 8.2 kg m 2 for Immature soils (Regosols). The variation within soil units was also large, and the coefficient of variation was almost 40%. The area-weighted average organic carbon density was 9.0 kg m 2 in the first 30 cm of soil, and 18.8 kg m 2 in the upper 1 m. The estimated total organic carbon stock in the forest soils of Japan was 4570F500 Tg (1 Tg = 1012 g) in the first 1 m (F95% confidence limit), excluding carbon held in the surface organic horizons and buried horizons. The Brown forest soils group (mostly Cambisols) made the largest contribution, with over 3000 Tg C. Forty-eight percent of the total organic carbon stock (2180 Tg C) was contained in the top 30 cm. The contribution of the surface layers to the organic carbon was clear. The wide variation in organic carbon density by soil type and the high density of organic carbon on a national scale in Japan is related to the distribution of volcanic ejecta. The concentration of organic carbon in the surface layers implies that soil conservation is important both to maintain land productivity and to counter global warming. The analysis of variability in the organic carbon density with soil type demonstrated that estimation methods should be improved.},

  Abstract                 = {Com base em levantamento pedológico de reconhecimento de alta intensidade, foram investigadas relações pedogeomorfológicas em uma área do Planalto Central Brasileiro, com vistas à predição de atributos e distribuição dos solos em áreas vizinhas carentes de mapas pedológicos. Três superfícies geomórficas, com distintos padrões de espacialização de solos, foram identificadas. Na mais elevada, a distribuição dos solos é estreitamente relacionada à variação do regime hídrico ao longo das encostas. Ocorrem Latossolo Vermelho (LV), Latossolo Vermelho-Amarelo (LVA), Latossolo Amarelo (LA), Latossolo Amarelo plíntico, Latossolo Amarelo petroplíntico (concrecionário) e Plintossolo Háplico, todos muito argilosos, com teores de Fe 2 O 3 e TiO 2 relativamente homogêneos e índices Ki e Kr indicativos de mineralogia oxídica. Na segunda superfície, os solos apresentam maior variação quanto à textura e teores de Fe e Ti. Predominam LV e LV acriférrico, além de LVA e LA. Nos limites com as chapadas, observa-se a ocorrência de LVA e LA acriférricos endopetroplínticos. Na terceira superfície, que disseca as anteriores, predominam solos menos intemperizados, com atributos muito variáveis, como Cambissolo Háplico, Argissolos Vermelho e Vermelho-Amarelo, Nitossolo Vermelho eutroférrico, Neossolo Litólico e Neossolo Flúvico. O trabalho inclui a proposição de um modelo de evolução para a paisagem regional.},

Of these capabilities, uncertainty assessment is the most poorly understood and implemented. Uncertainty assessment provides methodology to estimate the reliability of recommended alternatives, to place confidence intervals about the most likely outcome, or to quantify the likelihood of exceeding some environmental threshold. The extent to which this affects management decisions, and how it integrates with other management science disciplines such as risk assessment, remains largely unexplored territory. This paper briefly outlines sources of uncertainty in DSS, techniques for quantification, and then explores the relevance and importance of uncertainty in the larger decision-making context.},

  Abstract                 = {Remote sensing has considerable potential for providing accurate, up-to-date information in urban areas. Urban remote sensing is complicated, however, by very high spectral and spatial complexity. In this paper, beside traditional per-pixel method (annual NDVI change detection using Landsat TM images), Normalized Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (NSMA) was applied to map urban land cover. The TM images were acquired over the city of Szeged, Hungary in 1986 and 2009. The urban land use categories were classified according to the standard deviation (SD) of NDVI values of 8 TM images in 1986. Significant linear connection was calculated between the SD values and the sub-pixel rate of impervious surfaces. Impervious surface, one of the most important elements of the VIS model, has been recognized as a key indicator in assessing of the change of the urban environment in the last 25 years in the city. Fractional images of impervious surfaces developed from LTM images acquired in 1986 and 2009 were compared with each other and with the SD image of NDVI values. The spatial statistical analysis of internal land use change was developed on the the traditional urban zones. Later, the urban land cover map was the main database for the estimation of spatial distribution of urban heat island. The result of the geostatistical analysis demonstrated a very strong connection between urban land cover classes and spatial characteristics of urban heat island.},

Assim, é necessário que se desenvolva uma ?consciência pedológica?, a partir de um processo educativo que privilegie uma concepção de sustentabilidade na relação homem-natureza. Existem múltiplas formas, tempos e espaços de promover a educação para o meio ambiente a partir de uma abordagem pedológica; esse conjunto de conteúdos e métodos constituem a Educação em Solos, que é indissociável da Educação Ambiental. A Educação em Solos tem como principal objetivo trazer o significado da importância do solo à vida das pessoas e, portanto, da necessidade da sua conservação e do seu uso e ocupação sustentáveis. Assim como a Educação Ambiental, a Educação em Solos coloca-se como um processo de formação que, em si, precisa ser dinâmico, permanente e participativo. Nessa perspectiva, foi criado o Programa de Educação em Solos e Meio Ambiente (PES) junto ao Museu de Ciências da Terra do Departamento de Solos da UFV, que atua na educação formal e não-formal na região de Viçosa. A base teórico-metodológica da prática pedagógica do PES baseia-se no construtivismo e nas idéias de Paulo Freire, utilizando-se a abordagem holística, os métodos participativos e a prática da pedagogia de projetos. A perspectiva Construtivista-Freiriana promove uma abordagem dos temas pedológico-ambientais com base não apenas na simples transmissão do conhecimento, mas também da investigação, da experimentação e do resgate e valorização do conhecimento prévio das pessoas. A abordagem de aspectos que são familiares e conhecidos das pessoas, possibilitando uma aprendizagem significativa, embute em si um grande potencial para consolidar mudanças de valores e atitudes, ou seja, para efetivar uma consciência ambiental/ planetária.},

  Abstract                 = {The geomorphic evolution of the south-eastern Brazilian landscape is attributed to climatic changes coupled with tectonic activity. Soils developed on the resulting surfaces are mainly deep polygenetic Oxisols. The combination of stable landscapes (with continuously exposed soils) and neo-Cenozoic graben zones (episodically filled with sediments that may have undergone soil formation) offers the possibility to unravel the history of the soils that are found at the present day surface. Soil-sediment sequences in the southern part of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil were investigated by micromorphology and mineralogy in order to understand the genesis of the soils. Erosion (profile thinning), weathering, biological activity, clay accumulation and iron translocation are the main soil forming processes imprinted in the various pedosedimentary layers. Strong weathering is shown by dissolution of quartz and weathering of ilmenite. Bioturbation is ubiquitous even in older and deeper buried layers. Clay accumulation is observed as illuviation and precipitation features which were micromorphologically differentiated. Accumulation and movement of iron are represented by gley and pseudogley features, related to groundwater and surface-water saturation processes. These features and the layering of sediments and soils play key roles in understanding the evolutionary phases undergone by the soils and sediments. As main soil formation episodes, the graben fillings show two phases of clay formation and illuviation, separated by a phase of ferralitization, interrupted by various episodes of erosion. The whole material was eventually overprinted by a phase of ferralitization and plinthite formation. Apart from water saturation, these processes also appear to have acted on the soils of the stable areas (not affected by tectonic activity), but overprinting and erosion prevents recognition of the separate evolutionary phases.},

  Abstract                 = {This article reviews the use of optical and microwave remote sensing data for soil and terrain mapping with emphasis on applications at regional and coarser scales. Remote sensing is expected to offer possibilities for improving incomplete spatial and thematic coverage of current regional and global soil databases. Traditionally, remotely sensed imagery have been used to support segmentation of the landscape into rather homogeneous soil?landscape units for which soil composition can be established by sampling. Soil properties have also been inferred from optical and microwave data using physically-based and empirical methods. Used as a secondary data source, remotely sensed imagery may support spatial interpolation of sparsely sampled soil property data. Soil properties that have been measured using remote or proximal sensing approaches include mineralogy, texture, soil iron, soil moisture, soil organic carbon, soil salinity and carbonate content. In sparsely vegetated areas, successful use of space borne, airborne, and in situ measurements using optical, passive and active microwave instruments has been reported. On the other hand, in densely vegetated areas, soil data acquisition typically relied on indirect retrievals using soil indicators, such as plant functional groups, productivity changes, and Ellenberg indicator values. Several forms of kriging, classification and regression tree analyses have been used jointly with remotely sensed data to predict soil properties at unvisited locations aiming at obtaining continuous area coverage. We expect that remotely sensed data from existing platforms and planned missions can provide an important data source supporting digital soil mapping. Yet, most studies so far have been performed on a local scale and only few on regional or smaller map scale. Although progress has been made, current methods and techniques still bear potential to further explore the full range of spectral, spatial and temporal properties of existing data sources. For example, space borne spectroscopy has been of limited use in retrieving soil data when compared to laboratory or field spectroscopy. To date, there is no coherent methodology established, where approaches of spatial segmentation, measurements of soil properties and interpolation using remotely sensed data are integrated in a holistic fashion to achieve complete area coverage. Such approaches will enhance the perspectives of using remotely sensed data for digital soil mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on a literature review including 201 surface soils from wet, mild, mid-latitude climates and 290 soils from the Lower Saxony soil monitoring programme (Germany), we investigated the relationship between soil clay content and soil organic matter turnover. The relationship was then used to evaluate the clay modi?er for microbial decomposition in the organic matter module of the soil?plant? atmosphere model DAISY. A positive relationship was found between soil clay content and soil microbial biomass (SMB) C. Furthermore, a negative relationship was found between soil clay content and metabolic quotient (qCO 2 ) as an indicator of speci?c microbial activity. Both ?ndings support the hypothesis of a clay dependent capacity of soils to protect microbial biomass. Under the differing conditions of practical agriculture and forestry, no or only very weak relationships were found between soil clay content and non-living soil organic matter C (humus C). It is concluded that the stabilising effect of clay is much stronger for SMB than for humus. This is in contrast to the DAISY clay modi?er assuming the same negative relationship between soil clay content, on the one hand, and turnover of SMB and turnover of soil humus on the other. There is a positive relationship between SMB and microbial decomposition activity under steady-state conditions (microbial growth < microbial death). The original concept of a biomass-independent simulation of organic matter turnover in the DAISY model must therefore be rejected. In addition to the original modi?ers of organic matter turnover, a modi?er based on the pool size of decomposing organisms is suggested. Priming effects can be simulated by applying this modi?er. When using this approach, the original modi?ers are related to speci?c microbial activity. The DAISY clay modi?er is a useful approximation of the relationship between the metabolic quotient (qCO 2 ) as an indicator of speci?c microbial activity and soil clay content.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional soil analyses are expensive, time-consuming, and may also result in environmental pollutants. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a methodology to measure soil attributes using spectral reflectance (SR) as an alternative to traditional methods. Tropical Brazilian soils were sampled over a 196-ha area divided into grids. Samples (n = 184) were obtained from the 0- to 20- and 80- to 100-cm depths and georeferenced. The laboratory SR data were obtained using a Spectroradiometer (400?2 500 nm). Satellite reflectance values were sampled from corrected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images. Particle-size distribution and chemical analysis (organic matter [OM], cation-exchange capacity [CEC], total SiO2, Fe2 O3, TiO2, sum of cations, cation, and Al saturation) were performed in the laboratory. Statistical analysis and multiple regression equations for soil attribute predictions using radiometric data were developed. Laboratory data used 22 bands and 13 ??Reflectance Inflexion Differences, RID?? from different wavelength intervals of the optical spectrum. However, the satellite data used only the reflectance of the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 TM-Landsat bands. Multiple regression equations were derived from surface and subsurface soil layers. Estimations of some tropical soil attributes were possible using laboratory spectral analysis. Laboratory SR yielded high correlations with traditional laboratory analyses (R2 > 0.79) for the soil attributes such as clay, sand, TiO2, and Fe2O3. Satellite spectral data correlated well with most of the soil attributes such as clay, Fe2O3, and TiO2 (reaching R2 = 0.72). The use of soil analysis methodology by satellite and/or ground remote sensing constitutes an alternative to traditional routine laboratory analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {One ofthe important methods used to evaluate the effectiveness of soil erosion models is to compare the predictions given by the model to measured data from soil loss collected on plots taken under natural rainfall conditions. While it is recognized that plot data contain natural variability, this factor is not quantitatively considered during such evaluations because our knowledge of natural variability between plots which have the same treatments is very limited. The goal of this study was to analyse sufficient replicated plot data and present methodology to allow the model evaluator to take natural, within- treatment variability of erosion plots into account when models are tested. A large amount of data from pairs of replicated erosion plots was evaluated and quantified. The basis for the evaluation method presented is that if the difference between the model prediction and a measured plot data value lies within the population of differences between pairs of measured values, then the prediction is considered `acceptable'. A model `effectiveness' coefficient was defined for studies undertaken on large numbers of prediction versus measured data comparisons. This method provides a quantitative criterion for taking into account natural variability and uncertainty in measured erosion plot data when those data are used to evaluate erosion models.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluation of varios soil erosion models with large data sets have consistently shown that these models tend to over-predict soil erosion for smalm measured values, and uder-predict soil erosion for larger measured values. This trend appears to be consistent regardless of whether the erosion value of interest for individual storm, annual totals, or average annual soil losses, and regardless of whether the model is empirical or physically based. The hypothesis presented herein is that this phenomenon is not necessarily associated with bias in model predictions as a function of treatment, but rather with limitations in representing the ramdom component of the measured data within treatments (i.e., between replicates) with a deterministic model. A simple exemple is presented, showing how even a "perfect" deterministic soil erosion model exhibits bias relative to small and large measured erosion rates. The concept is further tested and verified on a set of 3007 measured soil erosion data pairs from storms of natural rainfall and run-off plots using the best possible, unbiased, real-world model, i.e., the physical model presented by replicated plots. The results of this study indicate that the ommonly observed bias, in erosion prediction models relative to over-prediction of small and under-prediction of large measured erosion rates on inividual data points, is normal and expected if the model is accurately predicting erosion rates as a function of environmental conditions, i.e., treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding and quantifying the large, unexplained variability in soil erosion data are critical for advancing erosion science, evaluating soil erosion models, and designing erosion experiments. We hypothesized that it is possible to quantify variability between replicated soil erosion field plots under natural rainfall, and thus determine the principal factor or factors which correlate to the magnitude of the variability. Data from replicated plot pairs for 2061 storms, 797 annual erosion measurements, and 53 multi-year erosion totals were used. Thirteen different soil types and site locations were represented in the data. The relative differences between replicated plot pair data tended to be lesser for greater magnitudes of measured soil loss, thus indicating that soil loss magnitude was a principal factor for explaining variance in the soil loss data. Using this assumption, we estimated the coefficient of variation of within-treatment, plot replicate values of measured soil loss. Variances between replicates decreased as a power function (r 2 5 0.78) of measured soil loss, and were independent of whether the measurements were event-, annual-, or multi-year values. Coefficients of variation ranged on the order of 14% for a measured soil loss of 20 kg/m 2 to greater than 150% for a measured soil loss of less than 0.01 kg/m2. These results have important implications for both experimental design and for using erosion data to evaluate prediction capability for erosion models.},

On the one hand, decision making in our field has traditionally been guided primarily by significance testing, using a Neyman?Pearson framework to make a decision to reject or not to reject a null hypothesis. Convention has dictated that the .05 significance level be regarded as the critical level to detect the presence of a real difference or a real effect. To be sure, in a given situation it is a personal decision to regard a particular p value as low enough to make us question the validity of the null hypothesis. On the other hand, Fisherian ideas, such as regarding conclusions as always provisional and in the nature of progress reports, have shown resurgent vigor as an alternative framework for decision making.},

Informações mais específicas são obtidas por meio de desdobramentos ortogonais dos graus de liberdade, comumente empregando contrastes. Entretanto, essa técnica torna-se complexa e de difícil implementação à medida que o número de tratamentos aumenta. Diante desse fato, utilizando-se como exemplo do uso da técnica, dados provenientes de um experimento de competição entre nove híbridos de milho, classificados em três tipos (simples, duplo e triplo), no delineamento em blocos casualizados, explicitou-se o emprego das variáveis auxiliares, que facilitam o desdobramento ortogonal dos graus de liberdade de tratamentos. Cada fator no modelo, após a decomposição, recebe uma codificação específica, tendo como valor, o nível do fator quando o tratamento for desse tipo, ou valor zero em caso contrário. O uso de variáveis auxiliares é uma forma simples e prática para determinar diferenças dentro dos grupos de interesse, embora não seja possível testar diretamente diferenças entre os grupos, o que pode também ser feito com a função CONTRAST do PROC GLM do SAS, mas não de forma tão simples.},

  Abstract                 = {Remotely sensed data might be an important tool for acquiring geographical information about soil attributes especially in areas where the soil surface is permanently or temporarily exposed, as in the extensive vineyard region of the Languedoc Roussillon region of France. By providing detailed spectral signature for every pixel, imaging spectrometry can potentially be used to identify the nature and abundance of some soil surface components. This chapter reports results obtained in the analysis of soil spectral data of the Low Languedoc Plains natural region of southern France acquired by an image spectrometer (Hyperspectral Mapper - HyMap) after laboratory calibration to make quantitative estimations of CaCO3 and clay content of surface soil horizons. Two different approaches for extracting information from soil reflectance spectra were used: (a) band depth analysis for estimating calcium carbonate and clay abundances and (b) a redness index to identify soil colour variations. Validation data are available on surface soil samples as visible-NIR and X-ray spectra, and chemical characterisations. For areas with soils developed from sedimentary materials of variable calcium carbonate and particle-size composition, we have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining quantitative information for CaCO3 content from the intensity of absorption of the feature centred at 2341 nm. CaCO3 estimates were highly satisfactory and at least as good as field effervescence test usually used in fieldwork. Clay particle-size content classes can also be estimated using the absorption depth of the clay minerals absorption feature at 2206 nm. Redness index along with clay and CaCO3 estimates allows characterisation and explanation of the intra-unit variability of a pre-existing 1:100,000 soil map, and could be further used as new covariates in order to refine limits or segment existing units.},

O solo estudado foi um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico típico. As amostragens de solo foram efetuadas em três repetições, nas profundidades de 0-5, 5-20 e 20-40 cm. Os sistemas foram selecionados segundo o histórico de uso, a saber: cerrado nativo (CN - testemunha); eucalipto + arroz (EA - ano zero do sistema agrossilvopastoril); eucalipto + soja (ES - ano um do sis- tema agrossilvopastoril); eucalipto + pastagem (EP - ano dois do sistema agrossilvopastoril); eucalipto + pastagem + gado (EPG - ano três do sistema agrossilvopastoril); pastagem convencional (PC) e eucalipto convencional (EC). Houve dife- rença significativa nos teores e no estoque de carbono dos sistemas avaliados em relação ao cerrado nativo. De modo geral, os sistemas estão desempenhando um papel de emissores de C-CO 2 , quando comparados com o CN, em que os vários re- volvimentos para o preparo do solo estão acelerando o processo de oxidação e perda de carbono orgânico. No sistema agrossilvopastoril, foi observada uma tendência de aumento do estoque do carbono com o passar dos anos, demonstrando a eficiência do sistema em manter ou até mesmo aumentar o estoque de carbono orgânico ao longo dos anos.},

  Abstract                 = {Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is believed the main anthropogenic greenhouse gas which causes global climate change. In the carbon cycle, forest plays an important role both as a carbon source and a carbon sink. Therefore, forest carbon inventories and emission reduction programs, in particular REDD, are one of the main efforts to combat climate change. REDD provides opportunities for Nepal and other developing countries to take part in the international carbon market and to promote sustainable forest management. Forest inventories and programs for emission reduction require robust methods to quantify carbon sequestration in forests. The combination of LiDAR data and high resolution satellite imagery is one of potential approach for assessing forest carbon sequestration. The application of LiDAR data and high resolution satellite imagery in carbon estimation are mostly based on the strong relationship between tree parameters, crown projection area (CPA) and height, with carbon stock of individual trees. A Canopy Height Model (CHM) is created from Airborne LiDAR data in order to derive the tree height information. The crown projection area is delineated from a very high resolution Geo-Eye satellite imageey with Region growing algorithm. Field-based carbon stock of individual tree (obtained through an allometric equation) is then related to CPA and height obtained from remote sensing data through multiple linear regression modelling. The crown delineated with Region growing resulted in 71.9% accuracy, LiDAR derived height fitted well with the measured height with the coefficient of determination R 2 =0.72. The object based image classification is applied to classify Shorea robusta and Other species with reasonable accuracy of 81% overall. Modelling the relationship between CPA and LiDAR derived height with carbon stock of Shorea robusta and Other species results in R 2 values of 0.76 and 0.68 respectively. In order to complete the carbon stock accounting and monitoring process, uncertainty estimates are required as an essential element of the process. Uncertainty estimates can help to reduce the uncertainty of inventories in the future, and guide decision on the choice of method. The combination of data requires more complex data processing and analysis techniques than using high resolution image or LiDAR data alone. As a result, the risk of error propagation through carbon estimation process is higher. The main sources of error are associated with ground-based sampling, LiDAR data processing, image processing and data integration processing. Most studies have used the standard error of regression equation as a measure of uncertainty but the uncertainty maybe two to three times the standard error. Accordingly, error propagation assessment needs to be evaluated to make correct inference about forest carbon stock. The trees used as the input for multiple linear regression analysis mostly affect the result of carbon estimation process. For the purpose of error propagation analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation is applied to generate a number of input datasets, which then were used to develop different regression predictive models of carbon. The input datasets were created by adding the random error to individual tree?s parameters (CPA, height, field-based carbon). Carbon stock then calculated based on simulated carbon predictive model. The results of different iterations were compared to see the effect of error propagation.},

The simulations illustrate that changes both in the magnitude of climate variability and in the persistence of above/below average conditions have the potential to modify the vegetation response to changes in mean climate. Simulated changes in moisture availability affect vegetation through drought stress or through changing the fuel availability in semi-arid regions where lack of fuel often limits the incidence of fire. Increasing moisture availability causes trees to replace grasses in China by reducing drought stress; increasing moisture availability in the Sahel increases the available fuel and hence reduces fire return times, favouring grasses. The modelling results imply that climate variability is important to vegetation dynamics; that not only the magnitude, but also the temporal structure of variability is important; and that correctly simulating vegetation changes in response to climate variability requires a realistic ?baseline? simulation of plant community composition. They further indicate that the impacts of climate change on ecosystems can sometimes derive as much from changes in variability as from changes in mean climate.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of mechanism in biology has three distinct meanings. It may refer to a philosophical thesis about the nature of life and biology (‘mechanicism’), to the internal workings of a machine-like structure (‘machine mechanism’), or to the causal explanation of a particular phenomenon (‘causal mechanism’). In this paper I trace the conceptual evolution of ‘mechanism’ in the history of biology, and I examine how the three meanings of this term have come to be featured in the philosophy of biology, situating the new ‘mechanismic program’ in this context. I argue that the leading advocates of the mechanismic program (i.e., Craver, Darden, Bechtel, etc.) inadvertently conflate the different senses of ‘mechanism’. Specifically, they all inappropriately endow causal mechanisms with the ontic status of machine mechanisms, and this invariably results in problematic accounts of the role played by mechanism-talk in scientific practice. I suggest that for effective analyses of the concept of mechanism, causal mechanisms need to be distinguished from machine mechanisms, and the new mechanismic program in the philosophy of biology needs to be demarcated from the traditional concerns of mechanistic biology. },

Based on field research in eastern Burkina Faso, the article demonstrates that farmers? theories of soil go beyond practical rules of thumb and include complex concepts about soil processes and fertility. In this sense they are similar to scientific theories of soil. It is argued that understanding the similarities and differences in soil related concepts, such as that of soil fertility, could do much more to improve communication between farmers, researchers and development workers than only comparing taxonomies. Furthermore, capturing the grammar (theories) rather than the sentences (taxonomies) provides a much clearer insight to how farmers will deal with changing circumstances and new crops than the static way in which local taxonomies are often treated. Finally, local soil theories are a better point of departure in terms of creating the necessary comprehension of farmer practices required for effective collaboration towards sustainable development.},

  Abstract                 = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from agricultural land is an important component of the total annual greenhouse gas (GHG) budget. In addition, uncertainties associated with agricultural N2O emissions are large. The goals of this work were (i) to quantify the uncertainties of modelled N2O emissions caused by model input uncertainty at point and landscape scale (i.e. resolution), and (ii) to identify the main sources of input uncertainty at both scales. For the Dutch western fen meadow landscape, we performed a Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation analysis using the INITIATOR model. The Monte Carlo analysis used novel and state-of-the-art methods for estimating and simulating continuous-numerical and categorical input variables, handling spatial and cross-correlations and analyzing spatial aggregation effects. Spatial auto- and cross-correlation of uncertain numerical inputs that are spatially variable were represented by the linear model of coregionalization. Bayesian Maximum Entropy was used to quantify the uncertainty of spatially variable categorical model inputs. Stochastic sensitivity analysis was used to analyze the contribution of groups of uncertain inputs to the uncertainty of the N2O emission at point and landscape scale. The average N2O emission at landscape scale had a mean of 20.5&#xa0;kg N2O-N ha?1 yr?1 and a standard deviation of 10.7&#xa0;kg N2O-N ha?1 yr?1, producing a relative uncertainty of 52%. At point scale, the relative error was on average 78%, indicating that upscaling decreases uncertainty. Soil inputs and denitrification and nitrification inputs were the main sources of uncertainty in N2O emission at point scale. At landscape scale, uncertainty in soil inputs averaged out and uncertainty in denitrification and nitrification inputs was the dominant source of uncertainty. This was partly because these inputs were assumed constant across areas with the same soil type and land use, which is probably not very realistic. Experiments at landscape scale are needed to assess the spatial variability of these fractions and analyze how a more realistic representation influences the uncertainty budget at landscape scale. This research confirms that results from uncertainty analyses are often scale dependent and that results for one scale cannot directly be extrapolated to other scales.},

The methodology was developed and based on the soil-land inference model – SoLIM, on the soil factor equation and the soil-landscape model. The fuzzy logic is able to simulate the uncertainty and transitions that often appear in pedologic systems. The results show that the methodology allows the generation of digital soil maps with increased scale and to reduce soil classe generalizations in the space and parameter domain. However, this methodology is very dependent upon the soil expert’s knowledge and accuracy of the data base.

  Abstract                 = {This study presents a combined geochemical and mineralogical survey of urban surface soils. Many studies on urban soils are restricted to purely chemical surveys in order to investigate soil pollution caused by anthropogenic activities such as traffic, heating, industrial processing, waste disposal and many more. In environmental studies, chemical elements are often distinguished as lithogenic and anthropogenic elements. As a novel contribution to those studies, the authors combined the analysis of a broad set of chemical elements with the analysis of the main mineralogical phases. The semi-quantification of mineralogical phases supported the assignment of groups of chemical elements to lithogenic or anthropogenic origin. Minerals are important sinks for toxic elements. Thus, knowledge about their distribution in soils is crucial for the assessment of the environmental hazards due to pollution of urban soils. In Pforzheim, surface soils (0-5 cm depth) from various land use types (forest, agriculture, urban green space, settlement areas of various site densities) overlying different geological units (clastic and chemical sediments) were investigated. Urban surface soils of Pforzheim reflect to a considerable degree the mineral and chemical composition of parent rocks. Irrespective of the parent rocks, elevated concentrations of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Pb, Sn, Ag) were found in soils throughout the whole inner urban settlement area of Pforzheim indicating pollution. These pollutants will tend to accumulate in inner urban surface soils according to the available adsorption capacity, which is normally higher in soils overlying limestone than in soils overlying sandstone. However, inner urban surface soils overlying sandstone show elevated concentrations of carbonates, phyllo-silicates and Fe and elevated pH values compared with forest soils overlying sandstone. Thus, in comparison to forest soils overlying sandstones, inner urban soils overlying sandstone affected by pollution concurrently possess elevated concentrations of mineral phases typically providing relatively high adsorption capacities for heavy metals.},

  Abstract                 = {Zuni farmers of western New Mexico demonstrate knowledge about soil and hydrological processes that link upland watersheds to alluvium-derived soils that have crucial cultural, ecological, and hydrological functions. To define how hillslopes contribute to productivity of soils derived from alluvium, we studied soil-vegetation-landform parameters in three headwater drainages on the Zuni Indian Reservation. Analyses along eight summit to toeslope transects show that soil properties follow parabolic and linear trends with changes driven by elevation, lithology, and vegetation in the mesa-canyon pinyon-juniper-Gambel oak (Pinus edulis Engelm.-Juniperus spp.-Quercus gambelii Nutt.) woodlands. Total organic C, N, and P concentrations in surface horizons follow negative parabolic trends and are highest on wooded backslopes and lowest on summits and toeslopes. Inorganic N and available P concentrations and total organic to inorganic N and P ratios increase linearly from summit to toeslope. Taken together, soil, landform, and vegetation data suggest: (i) summit positions are relatively stable with immobilizing microbial environments; (ii) inorganic nutrients increase progressively down steep and erodible hackslopes as inputs of forest litter are mixed with surface soil; (iii) influx of mixed sediment and organic materials from backslopes maintains concentrations of inorganic nutrients on footslopes and toeslopes. Entrenchment of drainage ways can circumvent these translocation processes. Without the influx of organic materials, footslopes and toeslopes may become nutrient-depleted as immobilization becomes the dominant microbial process. The results underscore the importance of functional connectivity between upland hillslopes and alluvial soils.},

Isso ocorre devido à contínua atividade geomorfológica, que contribuiu para a existência de diferentes classes pedológicas em pequenas distâncias. O trabalho foi desenvolvido em Juruena (MT), com o objetivo de identificar as classes pedológicas em microbacias sob floresta nãoperturbada, por meio do estudo da variabilidade espacial da textura (relação textural) e cor (índice de avermelhamento) do solo, considerando-se ainda a altitude da paisagem. A variabilidade espacial da textura e da cor do solo foi determinada em amostras de 185 pontos georreferenciados em malha sistemática regular com espaçamento de 20 x 20 m, abrangendo quatro microbacias. Usando profundidades de 0?20 e 40?60 cm, foi possível distinguir e mapear as principais classes de solo ocorrentes na área de estudo até o segundo nível categórico do Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos, associadas ao fator relevo da paisagem. Também foi estabelecida uma correspondência bastante satisfatória entre os intervalos do índice de avermelhamento do horizonte diagnóstico e as cores das classes de solo. As microbacias apresentaram as classes Plintossolos e Argissolos (com caráter plíntico) em altitudes inferiores a 280 m e Latossolos nas cotas superiores. Dessa forma, ficou evidenciada a possibilidade do uso da geoestatística para separar classes homogêneas de solo, além de estimar a precisão de mapeamento. Contudo, são indispensáveis o conhecimento pedológico e o trabalho posterior de campo para a aplicação e o ajuste dessa modelagem.},

  Abstract                 = {Disturbed soil samples, representing different textures and organic matter contents, were compressed uniaxially by a range of stresses and at varying water contents. Air permeability was measured immediately after compaction and tensile strength was measured after oven drying. The samples were taken from two soil types which had been subjected to three tillage treatments in a long-term field experiment and from the site of an experiment which compared the compaction caused by different tractor wheels. Within the range of practical interest, specific volume (i.e. the ratio of total volume to volume of solids) decreased with the log of applied stress and tensile strength increased linearly with applied stress. Specific volume also decreased with increasing water content at the time of compaction, whereas both tensile strength and air permeability increased. Soils with higher organic matter contents tended to have higher specific volumes and lower tensile strengths at a given water content and stress. The influence of water content on these properties upon compaction was less in soils of greater organic matter content. Similarly, the rate of increase of tensile strength with applied stress was less in soils of greater organic matter content. However, organic matter did not influence the relative change of specific volume with stress. In the tillage experiment, a stress applied in the laboratory of 100 kPa produced a specific volume similar to the average for ploughed soil in the field but 800 kPa was required to produce a specific volume similar to that obtained by direct drilling. A comparison with compaction values produced by vehicles in the field showed that a higher stress, by a factor of between 3 and 24, was required to reach the same specific volume in the laboratory as in the field. The tensile strength results indicated the susceptibility of the soils to clod formation and their ease of cultivation. Air permeability measurements gave some insight into the possible mechanics of compaction.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) provide a good way of deriving landform attributes that may be used for soil prediction. The geostatistical techniques of kriging and cokriging are increasingly being applied to predicting soil properties. Whereas ordinary kriging (and universal kriging) utilise spatial correlation to determine the coefficients of the linear predictor, cokriging involves both inter-variable correlation and spatial covariation among variables. Multi-linear regression modelling also offers an alternative to predicting a soil variable by means of covariation. The performance of predicting four soil variables by these methods and two regression-kriging models are compared. The precision and bias of prediction of the six methods were dependent on the soil variable predicted. The mean error of prediction indicates reasonably small bias of prediction for all the soil variables by almost all of the methods. With the exception of topsoil gravel, for which multi-linear regression performed best, the root mean square error showed the two regression-kriging procedures to be best. Further analysis based on the mean ranks of performance by the methods confirmed this. All the kriging methods involving covariables (landform attributes) have a more smoothing effect on the predicted values, thus minimising the influence of outliers on prediction performance. Both the methods of regression-kriging show promise for predicting sparsely located soil properties from dense observations of landform attributes derived from the DEM. Histograms of subsoil clay residuals show outliers in the data set. These outliers are more evident in multi-linear regression, ordinary kriging and universal kriging than regression-kriging. There was a clear advantage in using the regression-kriging methods on those variables which had a small correlation with the landform attributes: root mean square errors for all the soil variables are much smaller than those resulting from any of the multi-linear regression, ordinary kriging, universal kriging or cokriging methods.},

The methods, tested against ordinary kriging and universal kriging of the target variables, include multi-linear regression, isotopic cokriging, heterotopic cokriging and regression-kriging models A, B and C. Prediction performance by ordinary kriging and universal kriging was comparatively poor as the methods do not use covariation of the predictor variable with terrain attributes. Heterotopic cokriging outperformed isotopic cokriging because the former utilised more of the local information from the covariables. The combined regression-kriging methods generally performed well. Both the regression-kriging model C and heterotopic cokriging performed well when soil variables were predicted into a relatively finer gfidded digital elevation model (DEM) and when all the local information was utilised. Regression-kriging model C generally performed best and is, perhaps, more flexible than heterotopic cokriging. Potential for further research and developments rests in improving the regression part of model C.},

  Abstract                 = {The application of statistical techniques to spatially predicting soil attributes from ancillary variables evolved from Jenny's factors of soil formation, termed Climate, Organisms, Relief, Parent material and Time or corpt. The corpt approach was recently extended to include other soil attributes (s as surrogates) and space (n), and thus it is termed scorpan with time factor t in corpt replaced as age (a). The main objectives of this chapter are to collate and integrate various land feature digital layers to the same resolution and coordinate system, and to develop spatial prediction models based on scorpan and scorpan-kriging methods, for predicting selected soil attributes. Existing analogue maps were first digitised and transformed into digital maps. These, along with other existing digital information, were reprojected in the same coordinate system, the Geocentric Datum of Australia (1994) and Map Grid of Australia (1994), namely GDA-94 and MGA-94. Further these digital map layers, along with Landsat bands and digital terrain attributes, were used to predict soil attributes and thus producing different soil attribute maps for a number of soil depths. The spatial prediction methods used were scorpan methods, such as multiple linear regressions (MLR) and scorpan-kriging (SK), which combines simple kriging with MLR. While MLR was good enough model to predict a number of soil attributes, SK was more appropriate for electrical conductivity for two layers: 0-10 and 70-80 cm layers and was equally good, if not slightly better than the scorpan technique of MLR. However, the results of scorpan-kriging exhibit more detailed variation across the extent of the study area compared with kriging or MLR. The application of generalised linear and generalised additive models did not improve the prediction accuracy. Two of the soil attributes - clay content and electrical conductivity - for both the topsoil (0-10-cm depth) and subsoil (70-80-cm depth) are illustrated here. Both soil attributes have significant influence on the hydrological processes shaping the landscape. Finally, the digital land feature maps, including those of soil and digital terrain attributes, are displayed as geographical information systems (GIS) layers, which could potentially be useful for various environmental and catchment modelling.},

  Abstract                 = {Particle-size fractions (psf) of mineral soils and, hence, soil texture, are the most important attributes affecting physical and chemical processes in the soil. More often, psf data are available only at a few locations for a given area and, therefore, require some form of interpolation or spatial prediction. However, psf data are compositional and, therefore, require special treatment before spatial prediction. This includes ensuring posi- tive definiteness and a constant sum of interpolated values at a given lo- cation, error minimization, and lack of bias. In order to meet these re- quirements, this study applied two methods of data transformation prior to kriging of the psf of soils in two regions of eastern Australia. The two methods are additive log-ratio transformation of the psf (ALROK) and modified log-ratio transformation (mALROK). The performance of the transformed values by ordinary kriging was compared with the spatial prediction of the untransformed psf data using ordinary kriging, com- positional kriging (CK) (UTOK), and cokriging, based on the criteria- prediction bias or mean error (ME) and precision (root mean square er- ror (RMSE)), and validity of textural classification. ALROK and mALROK outperformed UTOK and CK in terms of prediction ME and RMSE. Be- cause of the closure effect on the psf data, UTOK, and, to a lesser extent, CK, did not meet all of the requirements for spatially predicting compo- sitional data and, therefore, performed poorly. mALROK outperformed all of the interpolation methods in terms of misclassification of soils into textural classes. The results show that without considering the special re- quirements of compositional data, spatial interpolation of psf data will necessarily produce uncertain and unreliable interpolated psf values.},

  Abstract                 = {Splines have often been used to approximate continuous depth functions of soil properties. Mathematical approaches have often fit polynomial curves through the mean value of a given soil property at pedogenic soil horizons, where the mean value is assumed to occur at the mid-point of the given horizon. The fit of such curves are highly sensitive to small variations in the soil property values at the soil horizons. Recently, a new tool that utilizes the equal-area spline has become available. The equal-area spline fits quadratic curves piecewise through soil horizons down the soil profile; these quadratic curves are joined at the soil horizon boundaries. The equal-area spline is so-called because within a soil horizon, the area between the mean property value and the portion of the curve above the mean value, and the portion of the curve below the mean value, respectively, is equivalent, which preserves the mean soil property value across the entire soil horizon as a whole. The splines are a rapid, effective way of estimating soil property values at user-specified standard depth increments, and do not require profiles to be sampled at fixed depths in order to do so. We have applied the equal-area spline function to SSURGO and STATSGO2 map unit components, and present preliminary results of mapping selected soil properties across the contiguous United States at standard depths.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents research showing how random errors in a fine toposcale digital elevation model (DEM) are propagated to DEM-based surface derivatives. The focus was on two constrained derivatives, slope and aspect, and one unconstrained derivative, drainage basin delineation. The error propagation was explored by using numerical and analytical methods, and in both approaches the DEM error was modelled as a second-order stationary Gaussian random process. The results were summarised in the case study, in which 32 realistic scenarios of DEM error models were used. The scenarios were based on exponential and Gaussian spatial autocorrelation models with four sills (0.0625, 0.25, 1.00, and 4.00&#xa0;m2) and practical ranges (0, 30, 60, and 120&#xa0;m). We found that, as expected, increase in DEM error increased the error in surface derivatives. However, contrary to expectations, the spatial autocorrelation model appears to have varying effects on the error propagation analysis depending on the application. In constrained surface derivatives, such as slope and aspect, the maximum error in results appeared to exist when the practical range of the error's spatial autocorrelation was roughly equal to the size of the surface derivative's calculation window. In unconstrained terrain analysis, such as drainage basin delineation, the variance of the results appeared to increase while the spatial autocorrelation range increases. Until now, the use of spatially uncorrelated DEM error models have been considered as a ?worst-case scenario?, but this opinion may now be challenged because none of the DEM derivatives investigated in the study had maximum variation with spatially uncorrelated random error. In addition, the study revealed that the role of the appropriate shape of the spatial autocorrelation model, either exponential or Gaussian, was not as important as the choice of appropriate autocorrelation parameters: practical range and sill. However, the shape of the spatial autocorrelation model appeared to have more influence on the calculation of slope and aspect than on the drainage basin delineation. For error propagation analysis purposes an analytical approach appears to be more useful for constrained derivatives, while the Monte Carlo method is appropriate for analysing both constrained and unconstrained derivatives.},

  Abstract                 = {Appropriate modelling and simulation of digital elevation model (DEM) uncertainty is among the most long- lasting of topics in geographical information science, because DEMs and terrain analysis are widely used in tasks with high societal impact. Decisions based on the analysis are expected to be of better quality if the uncertainty of the analysis results is taken into account. Despite the long research history of the topic, a few big challenges have decelerated the final break- through of the uncertainty-aware terrain analysis. Firstly, the utilisation of Monte Carlo simulation, which is the most flexible method for investigating the propagation of uncertainty in terrain analysis, is time-consuming. Moreover, the use of massive high-resolution DEMs based on airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) has made the performance issue even worse. Secondly, mainstream uncertainty-aware terrain analysis is done by applying stationary models of DEM uncertainty, even though the number of experiments has proven that the uncertainty would be modelled more realistically as a non-stationary stochastic process. The paper demonstrates how the process convolution method can be applied in a realistic and efficient non-stationary simulation of LIDAR DEM uncertainty.},

  Abstract                 = {SAGA is a free Geographical Information System (GIS) with support for vector and ? spe-cially ? raster data. This book describes the main features of SAGA, and its aimed at every user who wants to use the program whether as a learning tool (SAGA is a very good choice to discover GIS fundamentals) or as an all?purpose GIS with which develop ?real? geographical analysis. No GIS knowledge is assumed, so this work can be used as a self?study reference by all those who want to initiate themselves in the study of Geographical Information Systems. The book is conceptually divided in two parts: the ?rst one (chapters from 1 to 5) deals with basic SAGA functionalities, while the second one explain how to perform data analysis using some of the most important SAGA modules. Both parts seem rather independent, but they are closely related. You can read the ?rst part and you will get a good knowledge of SAGA and how it works, but if you don?t get into the second part you will not be able to get many results. On the other hand, you cannot study modules described in the second part without reading the ?rst one, since they all make use of SAGA core capabilities, which are explained in the ?rst ?ve chapters. For the technically inclined reader, I have included some information about the algorithms and technical concepts implemented in each module, targeted at those who like to get some beyond nuts?and?bolts descriptions. However, this information is rather limited, since the book will grow overwhelmingly large otherwise. Further references are provided in case you want to get a deeper knowledge of how a particular module works. The last chapter of the book, which could be considered as a very brief third part, introdu- ces the fundamentals of SAGA module programming. You should only read this chapter once you have become acquainted with the information from the previous chapters. Knowledge of C++ programming is assumed. If you have ideas for something to be added, removed or altered in this document, please let me know. I would love to get as much feedback as possible from readers.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the magnitude and causes of spatial variability of surface radiative fluxes in a complex alpine landscape in the Southern Alps of New Zealand. Radiative flux components are simulated for the Tekapo watershed at 100-m resolution for clear-sky summer days, using a surface radiation budget model in conjunction with satellite imagery and topographic modeling to derive surface parameters. Overall, the model results agree well with observations made at a range of sites, with shortwave fluxes simulated more accurately than longwave fluxes. Sensitivity studies were conducted to isolate the role of spatial variability of surface characteristics in generating variance in the radiation budget. In order of most to least important, these characteristics were found to be slope aspect, slope angle, elevation, albedo, shading, sky view factor, and leaf area index. Spatial variability was greatest in midmorning and midafternoon, as a function of optical depth. The role of landscape complexity in the spatial distribution of fluxes was investigated by considering three subareas of the watershed that contain strongly contrasting scales of autocorrelation of topography and surface cover. Increase in topographical com- plexity yielded a small decrease in spatial average net radiation and a large increase in spatial standard deviation, driven most signi?cantly by incident shortwave radiation. The regional averages scaled more or less linearly, whereas subregional-scale spatial variability differed dramatically.},

  Abstract                 = {Various methods were assessed to determine the impact of forest harvesting on mineral soil carbon (C) in Pinus radiata stands at Puruki catchment in the central North Island of New Zealand. Previous work at this site reported a reduction in soil carbon of 3.6 Mg ha1 in the top 0.1 m over one 23-year rotation of pine on improved pasture [Beets, P.N., Oliver, G.R., Clinton, P.W., 2002. Soil carbon protection in podocarp/hardwood forest, and the effects of conversion to pasture and exotic pine forest. J. Environ. Pollut. 116, S63?S73]. In this study, by sampling before and after harvesting, a further reduction of 3.1 Mg ha1 (significant at P = 0.05) in mineral soil carbon stocks to 0.1 m depth was found to be associated with harvesting disturbance. However, less intensive sampling was unable to detect any significant harvesting effects in depths down to 2 m. Variation between plots was large, and it was estimated that to detect a 10% change in carbon content with 95% confidence 19 permanent plots would be required for 0?0.1 m depth and 40 permanent plots required to detect changes to 1 m depth. Soil C content to 1 m depth in Puruki Rua subcatchment was estimated to average between 143 and 164 Mg ha1. In two paired-site studies comparing pasture with second rotation pine, the difference between land-uses in mineral soil C content to 0.1 m depth was 19.6 Mg ha1 in volcanic soil at Kaingaroa and 8.5 Mg ha1 in high clay activity soil at Ngaumu. Significant differences in mineral soil C between pine and pasture was found with cumulative depth down to 2 m, well below the rooting depth of pasture, which suggests that historic factors overshadowed influences of the current land-use and can account for the difference in soil carbon. At Kaingaroa, variability in soil carbon content was high at all depths measured, and to detect a 10% difference in soil carbon content with 95% confidence approximately 60 pits measured to 1 m depth would be required.},

  Abstract                 = {Geostatistics is basically a technology for estimating the local values of properties that vary in space from sample data. Research and development in the last 15 years has shown it to be eminently suited for soil and ripe for application in soil survey and land management. The basic technique, ordinary kriging, provides unbiased estimates with minimum and known variance. Data for related variables can be incorporated to improve estimates using cokriging. By more elaborate analysis using disjunctive kriging the probabilities of deficiency and excess can be estimated to aid decision.The variogram is crucial in all geostatistics; it must be estimated reliably from sufficient data at a sensible scale and modelled properly. Once obtained it can be used not only in the estimation itself but also to choose additional sampling sites, improve a monitoring network or design an optimal sampling scheme for a survey. It may also be used to control a multivariate classification so that the resulting classes are not too fragmented spatially to manage.},

As UGs foram delimitadas a partir da estratificação do meio físico e os valores de C total nos solos foram estimados em perfis descritos do Projeto Radambrasil. As áreas ocupadas por cada classe de solo foram estimadas em função de características pedo-geomorfológicas e, para o cálculo final da estimativa de C em cada UG, o valor médio de C por classe de solo foi multiplicado pela área ocupada por esta classe. Identificaram-se 4 UGs: (i) Maciço Montanhoso do Itatiaia/Alto Rio Preto: 106 t C ha-1 em altitudes que variam de 2787 a 1700 m e cobertura pedológica formada por Cambissolos e Latossolos Vermelho Amarelos; (ii) Planalto Soerguido do Alto Rio Preto: 96 t C ha-1 em altitudes entre 600 e 1.100 m e áreas isoladas que alcançam 1500 m, com cobertura pedológica representada por Cambissolos álicos, Latossolos Vermelho Amarelos e Afloramentos de Rochas; (iii) Maciço Montanhoso em Rochas Metassedimentares Proterozóicas: 71 t C ha-1, em altitudes que variam de 900 a 1.600 m e de 500 a 1.000 m com cobertura pedológica representada por Cambissolos, Latossolos Vermelho Amarelos e Afloramentos de Rochas; (iv) Planalto Deprimido do Médio Baixo Rio Preto: 55 t C ha-1 em altitudes que variam de 600 a 800 m, podendo chegar a 340 m e cobertura pedológica representada por Latossolos Vermelho Amarelos e Cambissolos álicos. Os valores de C encontrados nas UGs foram decrescendo quando se partiu da área localizada em altitudes maiores e com menor intervenção antrópica até a UG com menores altitudes, maior contingente populacional e atividades agropecuárias mais intensas. Isto indica que a metodologia fornece uma estimativa satisfatória, porém sem precisão de valores, apenas indicações sobre a relação do uso do solo e a conservação de C no sistema.},

The additional discovery of the use of NaOCl was considered to be very significant over the conventional H2O2 method where extra treatment with (NaPO3)8 was needed to obtain dispersion. However, in the case of fine textured forest soils it was found that for them to be in the dispersed state, additional washing with 2% aqueous Na2CO3-HaHCO3 must be performed after the NaOCl pretreatment.},

Based on this relationship, we estimated a global carbon sink of 0.12 (range 0.06 to 0.27) petagrams of carbon per year?1 resulting from erosion in the world?s agricultural landscapes. Our analysis directly challenges the view that agricultural erosion represents an important source or sink for atmospheric CO 2 .},

  Abstract                 = {Plant growth in restricted volumes of porous material is of interest for advanced life support systems for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration?s future space missions. Reduced gravity conditions may affect ? uid behavior in partially saturated porous media, requiring special considerations for growth media selection and root module design to ensure reliable water, air, and nutrient supply. Evidence suggests that ? uid displacement patterns become unstable and enhance phase entrapment in the absence of gravity, thereby modifying macroscopic transport properties essential for ? uid management decisions. Parabolic ? ight experiments have shown that preferential ? ows may lead to phase (air or gas) entrapment that would affect gaseous diffusion, as illustrated by lattice Boltzmann simulations. In microgravity, unstable ? ow patterns and particle rearrangement introduce uncertainty associated with particulate root growth media. These ? ndings suggest that future efforts toward designing porous media and plant root modules in reduced gravity should focus on engineered plant growth media with stable pore space and spatially segregated domains that support water and nutrient retention in addition to gas exchange.},

  Abstract                 = {Ecological restoration of forest ecosystems is increasingly being implemented in many parts of the world, as a response to widespread forest loss and degradation. In common with other conservation management interventions, restoration efforts should be directed towards areas where the maximum benefits are likely to be achieved. Such prioritisation requires the development of appropriate criteria and indicators (C&I), an issue poorly addressed by previous research. In particular, there is need for C&I that are operational, suitable for spatial analysis and mapping and applicable to a broad range of contexts. This investigation aimed to verify whether this might be achieved through the elicitation of experts' opinion, when considering biodiversity conservation as the main objective of restoration. A Delphi process was performed, aimed at defining the key ecological criteria and a broad set of indicators. 389 criteria and 669 related indicators were provided in total and grouped into clusters relating to individual criteria. A total of 20 criteria referred to the need for restoration and 18 to its feasibility. In the second round of the Delphi process, 8 definitive criteria were identified along with some 90 related indicators. Finally, a face-to-face meeting was conducted to show how ready-to-use C&I can be obtained for application to a specific context starting from the Delphi's results. The study highlights the potential value of combining the Delphi process and face-to-face meetings for identifying practically applicable C&I for planning ecological restoration. However, the diversity of views identified within a single group of stakeholders suggests that the development of a generally applicable set of C&I for forest restoration will be difficult to achieve in practice.},

In this paper, we present our findings from a research project conducted in two villages in Tanzania and two villages in Uganda. The project?s objective was to develop methodologies for comparing and integrating scientific and indigenous knowledge of soil and land resources, using Geographical Information System (GIS) as an integration domain. Our focus is on methods and issues in exploring local knowledge of soils. We first give a short overview of the process of exploring local knowledge of soils and the different methodologies used. We present some of the limitations and opportunities that we have encountered during the analysis, arising from the differences in methodologies used and the epistemological differences associated with each knowledge source. The paper highlights the risk that an uncritical approach to local knowledge may lead to misunderstandings and misconceptions that are not apparent until more detailed research is conducted.},

  Abstract                 = {The universal soil loss equation (USLE) is an erosion model to estimate average soil loss that would generally result from splash, sheet, and rill erosion from agricultural plots. Recently, use of USLE has been extended as a useful tool predicting soil losses and planning control practices by the effective integration of the GIS-based procedures to estimate the factor values on a grid cell basis. This study was performed for ?ve different lands uses of Indag?? Mountain Pass, Cank?r? to predict the soil erosion risk by the USLE/GIS methodology for planning conser- vation measures in the site. Of the USLE factors, rainfall- runoff erosivity factor (USLE-R) and topographic factor (USLE-LS) were greatly involved in GIS. These were sur- faced by correcting USLE-R site-speci?cally using DEM and climatic data and by evaluating USLE-LS by the ?ow accumulation tool using DEM and watershed delineation tool to consider the topographical and hydrological effects on the soil loss. The study assessed the soil erodibility factor (USLE-K) by randomly sampled ?eld properties by geo- statistical analysis. Crop management factor for different land-use/land cover type and land use (USLE-C) was assigned to the numerical values from crop and ?ora type, canopy and density of ?ve different land uses, which are plantation, recreational land, cropland, forest and grassland, by means of reclassifying digital land use map available for the site. Support practice factor (USLE-P) was taken as a unit assuming no erosion control practices. USLE/GIS technology together with the geostatistics combined these major erosion factors to predict average soil loss per unit area per unit time. Resulting soil loss map revealed that spatial average soil loss in terms of the land uses were 1.99, 1.29, 1.21, 1.20, 0.89 t ha ?1 year ?1 for the cropland, grass- land, recreation, plantation and forest, respectively. Since the rate of soil formation was expected to be so slow in Central Anatolia of Turkey and any soil loss of more than 1 ton ha ?1 year ?1 over 50?100 years was considered as irreversible for this region, soil erosion in the Indag?? Mountain Pass, to the great extent, attained the irreversible state, and these ?ndings should be very useful to take mitigation measures in the site.},

  Abstract                 = {Inversion of relief occurs when materials on valley floors are, or become, more resistant to erosion than the adjacent valley slopes. As erosion proceeds, the valley floor becomes a ridge bounded by newly formed valleys on each side. Areas of lava flows contain many examples of inversion of relief, but it is also common in areas of duricrusts. Inversion of relief is so widespread in some areas that it should be regarded as a general component in a model of landscape evolution. Inversion of relief has some important implications. Drainage lines will shift significantly over time. Slope-soil relationships (catenas) have to be reassessed, because the regolith on the upper part of a hill slope may have developed under very different conditions from those existing at present. The resulting catena is not a simple expression of soils and response to landscape position. This also has important implications for geochemistry. Where present day ridge tops were once valley floors, geochemical signatures will reflect lateral water movement in the old landscape rather than simple in situ weathering and vertical redistribution in the present landscape. Finally, inversion of relief can produce erosion surfaces of very low relief that cannot be termed peneplains, pediplains or etchplains because they have a very different genesis. This underlines the importance of determining the complexities of landscape evolution before such genetic terms are applied to any landscape.},

The properties of colluvial deposits of the two stratigraphic sections made possible to characterize the pedological source cover of its material and to identify the respective disposal process. Exposing both information, it is possible to understand the role of morphogenesis in the evolution of slopes area. The morphogenesis was presented in the studied slopes through the frequent action of superficial running. Exceptional pluviometric events were responsible for the unleashing of mass movements in the rebording of plateau, generating deposits of colluvial in high slopes. These not usual events correspond to the last evolutionary stages of slopes, accelerating its recoil and modifying its morphology. It is believed that these phenomena acted in scale in the middle valley of Marrecas River.},

  Abstract                 = {Corporate and social requirements relating to sustainable mining practices have resulted in an increasing need for identification and assessment of natural features that may be susceptible to coalmine-induced subsidence. Natural features such as, cliff lines, watercourses and steep slopes, that are typically susceptible to subsidence-induced impacts can often be identified and quantified using high-resolution topographic data and a geographic information system (GIS). Once identified, digital representations of these features can be used in the impact assessment process and for Subsidence Management Plan (SMP) preparation. This paper demonstrates the use of topographic data for site characterisation and feature identification purposes by mapping susceptible areas for a study site, including valley floors, steep slopes, drainage lines, and erosion-prone areas. It also discusses the potential use of topographic data and GIS for assessing subsidence impacts through knowledge- and data-driven approaches. The assessment of pre- and post-subsidence hydrological conditions is also shown for two swamps within the study area. The area over the proposed Dendrobium Area 2 operation in the Southern Coalfield was chosen as a case study site, and high-resolution airborne laser scan data were acquired for the site from BHP Billiton.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use strongly influences soil properties and unsuitable practices lead to degradation of soil and environmental quality. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of different land uses on some chemical properties of soils developed from Pliocene clays, within hilly environments of central and southern Italy. The areas investigated are located in Vicarello di Volterra (Pisa, Tuscany), S. Quirico d'Orcia (Siena, Tuscany) and Soveria Simeri (Catanzaro, Calabria). Within each area different land uses were compared, including a natural ecosystem (Mediterranean bush), a perennial grass or pasture and an intensive crop (wheat, as monoculture or in rotation). The soils were sampled at 0.0-0.1, 0.1-0.2 and 0.2-0.4 m depth and analysed for particle size, pH, bulk density, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable cations, total organic carbon (TOC) and humified carbon (HC) concentrations, organic carbon stock and total N. The stratification ratio of soil organic carbon was calculated to characterize soil organic carbon distribution with depth. At all sites, soil under Mediterranean bush contained the largest amounts of TOC (as both concentration and stock), HC, total N and exchangeable K, together with the highest cation exchange capacity and the lowest pH values. The decrease in soil OC stock with land use change from natural to agricultural ecosystem was 65-85% to 0.1 m depth, 55-82% to 0.2 m depth and 44-76% to 0.4 m depth, with the lowest decrements for perennial grass from S. Quirico and the highest decrement for continuous wheat from Soveria Simeri. Continuous wheat cropping, based on conventional tillage, proved to be the least sustainable land use. At Soveria Simeri, the organic carbon content under pasture was not significantly larger than under wheat cultivation, probably because of grazing mismanagement; however, organic carbon under pasture was more humified. At S. Quirico, the perennial grass resulted in a significant increase in soil organic carbon at the soil surface relative to the wheat cultivation, while at Vicarello no differences were observed between alfalfa/wheat rotation and perennial grass. Our results lead to the questioning of sustainability of intensive cereal farming and uncontrolled grazing in the considered environments, emphasizing the need for greater attention to conservative land managements.},

  Abstract                 = {The literature on the formation, structure and properties of allophane and imogolite is reviewed, with particular emphasis on the seminal contributions by Colin Farmer. Allophane and imogolite occur not only in volcanic-ash soils but also in other environments. The conditions required for the precipitation of allophane and imogolite are discussed. These include pH, availability of Al and Si, rainfall, leaching regime, and reactions with organic matter. Because of their excellent water storage and physical properties, allophanic soils can accumulate large amounts of biomass. In areas of high rainfall, these soils often occur under rain forest, and the soil organic matter derived from the forest biomass is stabilized by allophane and aluminium ions. Thus the turnover of soil organic matter in allophanicsoils is slower than that in non-allophanic soils. The organic matter appears to be derived from the microbial by-products of the plant material rather than from the plant material itself. The growth of young forests may be limited by nitrogen supply but growth of older forests tends to be P limited. Phosphorus is recycled through both inorganic and organic pathways, but it is also strongly sorbed by Al compounds including allophane. When crops are grown in allophanic soils, large amounts of labile P are required and, accordingly, these soils have to be managed to counteract the large P sorption capacity of allophane and other Al compounds, and to ensure an adequate supply of labile P. Because of their physical and chemical properties, allophanic soils are excellent filters of heavy metals and pathogens.},

  Abstract                 = {Summary.  We introduce a path following algorithm for L1-regularized generalized linear models. The L1-regularization procedure is useful especially because it, in effect, selects variables according to the amount of penalization on the L1-norm of the coefficients, in a manner that is less greedy than forward selection–backward deletion. The generalized linear model path algorithm efficiently computes solutions along the entire regularization path by using the predictor–corrector method of convex optimization. Selecting the step length of the regularization parameter is critical in controlling the overall accuracy of the paths; we suggest intuitive and flexible strategies for choosing appropriate values. We demonstrate the implementation with several simulated and real data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {An appropriate inclusion of spatial variation of soils is becoming increasingly important for spatially distributed ecological modelling approaches. Even though soils are anisotropic vertically and laterally, most soil spatial variability studies have focused on the lateral variation of soil attributes over the landscape. This study characterizes the complexity of three-dimensional variations of individual soil attributes and examines the possibility of predicting soil property distribution using three different regression approaches: artificial neural networks (ANN), regression trees (RT) and general linear models (GLM). Thirty-two physiochemical attributes of 502 soil samples were collected from 64 soil profiles on a slope at Bicknoller Combe, Somerset, UK. After a principal component analysis, five soil attributes were selected to test for environmental correlation, assuming they reflect dominant pedological processes at the hillslope. Vegetation occurrence, soil types, terrain parameters and soil sample depth were used as predictors. Prediction using environmental variables was most successful for soil attributes whose spatial distribution is strongly influenced by lateral hydrological and slope processes with relatively simple depth functions (e.g. total exchangeable bases, Mn oxides and soil pH). These soil attributes also showed a high mobility, which implies that their spatial distribution quickly reaches an equilibrium with current slope processes. Soil taxonomic information only marginally improved the performance of models constructed from surface information such as vegetation and terrain parameters. On the other hand, soil attributes whose vertical distribution is strongly governed by vertical pedogenesis or unknown factors were poorly modelled by environmental variables due to stronger nonlinearity in their vertical distribution. Soil taxonomic information becomes more important for predicting these soil attributes. As an empirical modelling tool, GLM with interaction terms outperformed the other two methods tested, ANN and RT, in terms of both the simplicity of the model structure and the performance of derived empirical functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Um dos fenômenos de grande escala que mais afetam o tempo e o clima de diferentes locais na superfície terrestre e que tem sido bastante estudado nas últimas três décadas é o fenômeno El Niño Oscilação Sul (ENOS). O ENOS provoca alterações na circulação atmosférica que afetam os elementos meteorológicos, principalmente a precipitação pluviométrica, em todas as regiões do Brasil. Em anos de El Niño, fase positiva do fenômeno, a precipitação pluviométrica é freqüentemente acima da normal na Região Sul do Brasil e em anos de La Niña, fase negativa do fenômeno, a precipitação pluviométrica é freqüentemente abaixo da normal. Algumas características das precipitações pluviométricas são afetadas pelo ENOS como a freqüência, a intensidade e a quantidade. Essas características são importantes para se definir se as chuvas são erosivas. Existem alguns métodos de determinação da erosividade das chuvas, através de índices de erosividade, entre os quais, o melhor e mais usado no Rio Grande do Sul (RS) é o Índice de Erosividade EI 30 . O objetivo desta dissertação foi determinar e associar o Índice de Erosividade EI 30 das chuvas com o fenômeno ENOS para Santa Maria, RS. Usaram-se os dados de precipitação diária retirados de pluviogramas a partir de 01 de julho de 1978 a 30 de junho de 2008 coletados na Estação Climatológica Principal de Santa Maria, RS. As chuvas individuais e erosivas foram identificadas nos pluviogramas, classificadas em anos de El Nino, La Niña e Neutros e calculado o seu índice EI 30 . Também foram classificadas as chuvas em padrões de chuvas Avançado, Intermediário e Atrasado. Foi realizada a análise de correlação de Pearson e análise de regressão entre o Índice de Erosividade EI 30 e o Índice Oceânico do Niño (ION) e a significância da regressão foi testada com o teste t com o objetivo de quantificar a associação entre as duas variáveis, com vistas à possível previsibilidade do potencial erosivo das chuvas a partir de anomalias de Temperatura da Superfície do Mar (TSM) no Oceano Pacífico. O potencial erosivo das chuvas em Santa Maria é afetado pelo fenômeno ENOS, de modo que um maior número de chuvas tem maior potencial erosivo em anos de El Niño e em anos Neutros. A variabilidade do potencial erosivo das chuvas em Santa Maria é maior nos anos Neutros do que nos anos de anomalia da TSM. A distribuição de freqüência do índice de erosividade EI 30 de chuvas individuais é assimétrica positiva em anos de El Niño, La Niña e Neutros. O padrão das chuvas é alterado em anos de anomalia da TSM no sentido de que nos anos El Niño há um leve acréscimo nas chuvas de padrão avançado e em anos de La Niña há um leve acréscimo nas chuvas de padrão atrasado, e no padrão intermediário, decrescem o número de chuvas em anos de El Niño e La Niña comparado com anos Neutros. A capacidade preditiva do potencial erosivo das chuvas em Santa Maria pelo Índice ION é fraca ou inexistente.},

  Abstract                 = {Compositional data are those which contain only relative information. They are parts of some whole. In most cases they are recorded as closed data, i.e. data summing to a constant, such as 100% ? whole-rock geochemical data being classic examples. Compositional data have important and particular properties that preclude the application of standard statistical techniques on such data in raw form. Standard techniques are designed to be used with data that are free to range from - 8 to + 8. Compositional data are always positive and range only from 0 to 100, or any other constant, when given in closed form. If one component increases, others must, perforce, decrease, whether or not there is a genetic link between these components. This means that the results of standard statistical analysis of the relationships between raw components or parts in a compositional dataset are clouded by spurious effects. Although such analyses may give apparently interpretable results, they are, at best, approximations and need to be treated with considerable circumspection. The methods outlined in this volume are based on the premise that it is the relative variation of components which is of interest, rather than absolute variation. Log-ratios of components provide the natural means of studying compositional data. In this contribution the basic terms and operations are introduced using simple numerical examples to illustrate their computation and to familiarize the reader with their use.},

  Abstract                 = {Methodologies for collection and integration of scientific and indigenous soils knowledge are discussed in relation to two interdisciplinary projects involving soil scientists, other natural scientists and anthropologists. In Uganda and Tanzania, participatory methods paralleled scientific soil survey. Indigenous or ?local? soil classification was explored by a semi-structured, iterative discussion with farmers, resulting in classes that could be related to scientific taxa. However, the relation of farmers? cognitive soil maps to scientific soil maps in the Geographical Information Systems (GIS), developed as an integration domain, was problematic. In-depth analysis was only achieved through geo-referencing local knowledge (LK) using global positioning system (GPS). In Bangladesh, ethnographic methods obtained local soils knowledge and its socio-cultural context, and accompanied scientific surveys of floodplain soils and agroecosystems. Subsequent data processing included database and GIS tools, but there were problems systematically relating the two knowledge bases. The sequencing of, and iteration between, methods used to access and analyse geo-referenced scientific and local soils knowledge are critical considerations in such research.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003.},

  Abstract                 = {The soil types Neossolos Litólicos (Leptosols) and Neossolos Regolíticos (Regosols) have been poorly studied in Brazil, due to their relatively low potential for agricultural use. Consequently the morphological description of Neossolos in the field is also hampered, particularly in terms of contacts between soil, saprolite and rock, and their classification in the Brazilian Soil Classification System. The purpose of this study was: to define morphologically the contact between soil, saprolite and rock in Neossolos; generate data of the saprolite layer and test an inclusion in the suborder Neossolos Litólicos and Neossolos Regolíticos; and evaluate the diagnostic attributes and classes available in the Brazilian Soil Classification System for the of Neossolos Litólicos and Regolíticos derived from volcanic rocks of the Serra Geral formation in Rio Grande do Sul, State, Brazil. Five profiles of litho-climosequence were analyzed. The contacts were characterized based on the straight shovel excavation test associated to analyses of saprolite fracture and weathering classes. The contacts related to the presence of saprolite layers identified in the profile are not taken into consideration in the Brazilian Soil Classification System. Diagnostic attributes for the classification of Neossolos Regolíticos were proposed as well as a change of the term from "Regolítico" to "Saprolítico". New classes were also suggested for the third categorical level, based on information such as soil position and saprolite contact, excavation resistance and cracking level of the material. The proposed diagnostic attributes and classes allowed a more adequate classification of Neossolos derived from volcanic rocks in the State of Rio Grande do Sul.},

However, the secondary information used in present methods is limited to analytical data and simple topographical indices derived from DEM, which lack the power to account for the immigration and distribution of soil carbon in cultivated fields. Hydrological information is more closely related to the immigration and distribution of soil carbon and so should be considered for soil carbon mapping. An exploration of several indices shows that the wetness index (WI, an index used to quantify the influence of hydrological process based on local topography), which incorporates topographical and hydrological information, using Collocated Cokriging (CC) yields the best result. This trial indicates that CC (with WI-md) not only significantly reduces estimation uncertainties but also reveals more details of the distribution of soil carbon.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Forest soils store a substantial amount of carbon, often more than the forest vegetation does. Estimates of the amount of soil carbon, and in particular estimates of changes in these amounts are still inaccurate. Measuring soil carbon is laborious, and measurements taken at a few statistically unrepresentative sites are difficult to scale to larger areas.We combined a simple dynamic model of soil carbon with litter production estimated on the basis of stand parameters, models of tree allometry and biomass turnover rates of different biomass components. This integrated method was used to simulate soil carbon as forest stands develop. The results were compared with measurements of soil carbon from 64 forest sites in southern Finland.Measured carbon stocks in the organic soil layer increased by an average of 4.7±1.4 g m-2 a-1 with increasing stand age and no significant changes were measured in the amount of carbon in mineral soil. Our integrated method indicated that soil carbon stocks declined to a minimum 20 years after clear-cutting and the subsequent increase in the soil carbon stock (F/H - 1 m) was 5.8±1.0 g m-2 a-1 averaged over the period to next harvesting (~125 years). Simulated soil carbon accumulation slowed down considerably in stands older than 50 years. The carbon stock measured (F/H - 1 m) for the study area averaged 6.8±2.5 kg m-2. The simulated carbon stock in soil was 7.0±0.6 kg m-2 on average.These tests of the validity of the integrated model suggest that this method is suitable for estimating the amount of carbon in soil and its changes on regional scales.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic matter is a major component of biogeochemical cycles and is important in maintaining soil quality. We investigated relationships between soil organic C and various soil and site properties that may influence long-term soil C accumulation across a range of soil orders in New Zealand. We used pedon and climatic data for 167 pedons under permanent grass, and carried out regression analysis between soil C (0-200 mm) contents it ha-1) or concentrations (g kg-1) and climatic and soil properties, namely, precipitation, temperature, and contents or concentrations of sand, silt, clay, pyrophosphate-extractable Al (Alpy), Fe oxide, and allophane. Soil clay content or concentration explained little of the variation in soil C across all soils (R2 < 0.05) and within each soil type. Likewise, mean annual precipitation and temperature explained little variation in soil C content or concentration (R2 < 0.15 for precipitation, R2 = 0.04 for temperature). Allophane content or concentration was unrelated to soil C in the soils of volcanic origin; Alpy, however, correlated strongly with both soil C content and soil C concentration across all soil types (R2 = 0.55 and 0.60, respectively). When all factors were combined in a multiple regression analysis, the combination of Alpy and allophane contents explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C content (R2 = 0.57), whereas the combination of Alpy, Fe oxide, allophane, and clay concentrations explained the greatest amount of variation in soil C concentration (R2 = 0.67). Out results suggest that in New Zealand soils, chemical stabilization of organic matter is the key process controlling soil C accumulation, and that clay content relates poorly to long-term soil organic C accumulation.},

Procedures adopted in soil surveys for organic carbon measurement are therefore of major importance to classify the soils, and to correlate their properties with data from other studies. To evaluate different methods for measuring organic carbon and organic matter content in Histosols and soils with histic horizons, from different regions of Brazil, 53 soil samples were comparatively analyzed by the methods of Walkley & Black (modified), Embrapa, Yeomans & Bremner, modified Yeomans & Bremner, muffle furnace, and CHN. The modified Walkley & Black (C-W & B md) and the combustion of organic matter in the muffle furnace (OM-Muffle) were the most suitable for the samples with high organic carbon content. Based on regression analysis data, the OM-muffle may be estimated from C-W & B md by applying a factor that ranges from 2.00 to 2.19 with 95% of probability. The factor 2.10, the average value, is suggested to convert results obtained by these methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The rates and mechanisms of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) decomposition were examined in a series of soil suspensions at H2O2 concentrations comparable to those found in rainwaters. The formation of hydroxyl radical (OH) as a possible decomposition intermediate was investigated using a new, highly sensitive method. In surface soils with higher organic matter or manganese content, H2O2 usually decayed rapidly, with disproportionation to water and dioxygen dominating the decomposition, whereas the formation of the hydroxyl radical (OH) represented <10% of the total H2O2 decomposed. In contrast, for soils with lower organic matter content, H2O2 usually decayed much more slowly, but OH was a major product of the H2O2 decomposed. The decomposition was principally associated with soil particles, not the soil supernatant. Different sterilization techniques indicated that decomposition of H2O2 was at least partly due to biological activity. Because the loss of H2O2 can largely be accommodated by the production of O2 and OH within these soils, our results suggest that disproportionation through a catalase-type mechanism and the production of OH through a Haber-Weiss mechanism represent the principal routes through which H2O2 is lost.},

  Abstract                 = {The 21st century has brought new challenges for forest management at a time when global climate change is becoming increasingly apparent. Additional to various goods and services being provided to human beings, forest ecosystems are a large store of terrestrial carbon and account for a major part of the carbon exchange between the atmosphere and the land surface. Depending on the management regime, forests can thus be either a sink, or a source of atmospheric carbon. Southeast Asia or ASEAN comprises 10 countries of different cultures and political background. Rapid economic development and fast-growing population in the region have raised much concern over the use of natural resources, especially forest resources. This study aims at finding the appropriate measures for sustainable use and management of tropical forests on a long-term basis. Between 1990 and 2000, about 2.3 million ha of forest were cleared every year and lost to other forms of land use. In terms of carbon emissions, a net amount of approximately 465 million t per year were released to the atmosphere over the same period, which amounts to 29% of the global net carbon release from deforestation worldwide. This study provides an approach to analyzing the implications of alternative forest and land management options on forest carbon stocks. This is done in three steps: First, observed trends in land use are expressed in terms of a model in order to create a scenario for the period 1980?2050. Second, forest management practices and timber production rates are analyzed and three management scenarios are created: (1) continuing the current rate of exploitation, (2) management for long-term economic gains, and (3) climate-beneficial management. Third, the impact of the three scenarios on regional carbon storage is estimated on the basis of a carbon balance model. Comparing the additional rate of carbon sequestration of scenario (3) over scenario (2), and taking into account differing management costs, we also discuss a framework for industrialized countries to invest in carbon credits in the region in order to fulfil their commitments under present and future climate protection agreements.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils and landscapes are subject to historical and spatial contingency, leading to locally unique pedologic features. This can make broad-scale generalizations difficult, impractical, or even impossible. The development of vertical texture-contrast soils with argillic horizons, for example, is potentially subject to all general forms of spatial and historical contingency. A case study in east Texas shows evidence both supporting and refuting five general classes of explanation for the formation of vertical textural contrasts. Multiple causality is likely, and attempts to apply any single explanation to a county-size area (and sometimes to a pedon) are not likely to be successful. The implication is not that pedologists should abandon the search for generalizations, but that the context in which laws and generalizations are developed needs rethinking. Explanatory constructs should be formulated not with the notion that a single explanation is likely to be applicable to most soils, but with the idea that multiple causality and polygenesis are likely, and that location-specific characteristics cannot be ignored. The search is directed not toward a single principle to explain the majority of cases and against which exceptions can be judged, but toward a set of principles that define the possibilities (or probabilities). Two analogies that may be useful in addressing historical and spatial contingency in soils are proposed, based on demographic and synoptic metaphors.},

  Abstract                 = {A number of hypotheses and conceptual models, particularly those emphasizing nonlinear dynamics and self-organization, postulate increases or decreases in complexity in the evolution of drainage basins, topography, soils, ecosystems, and other earth surface systems. Accordingly, it is important to determine under what circumstances and at what scales either trend might occur. This paper is concerned with changes in soil landscape complexity due to redistribution of sediment by fluvial, aeolian, and tillage processes at historical time scales in an agricultural field system near Grifton, North Carolina. Soil mapping and soil stratigraphic investigations were used to identify and map soil changes associated with erosion and deposition by water, wind, and tillage; reconstruct the pre-agricultural soil pattern; and identify transformations between soil types. The Kolmogorov entropy of the pre- and post- agricultural landscapes was then compared. The soil transformations associated with erosion and deposition created four distinct new soils and made possible new transformations among soil series, increasing the number of soil types from seven to 11 and the number of possible transformations from 14 to 22. However, the entropy and complexity of the soil landscape decreased, with associated increases in information and redundancy. The mass redistributions created a lower-entropy landscape by concentrating particular soils and soil transformations in specific landscape settings. This result is contrary to studies showing a trend toward increasing pedological complexity at comparable spatial scales, but over much longer time scales. These results point to the importance of temporal scale, and to the fact that environmental complexity is influenced by factors other than the number of different landscape units present.},

  Abstract                 = {Several analytical techniques were applied in the study of the Alemoa Member (Santa Maria formation) and Caturrita formation to make an assessment of changing paleoenvironmental conditions through the Triassic succession of southern Brazil. This included a integration of petrography, X-ray diffractometry, scanning electron microscopy and chemical analysis of both major and minor elements, as well as uranium (U) and thorium (Th). The studied succession comprises part of the Triassic continental deposits of the Parana? Basin in South America and represents channel deposits surrounded by ?ne-grained ?ood plain facies. This stratigraphic interval is interpreted as an anastomosing ?uvial system (Alemoa Member) that has gradually evolved into a braided system (Caturrita formation). The chemical index of alteration (CIA), which is determined through the rock chemical composition, was used to highlight weathering processes on primary minerals. The CIA follows an upward trend representing an increase on weathering conditions from the Alemoa Member to the Caturrita formation. The deep chemical alteration in the Caturrita formation suggests weathering under a humid, possibly tropical climate. These results are in agreement with U and Th analysis. The Th/U ratios rise toward the top of the section (Caturrita formation) suggesting an increasingly more humid climate. Thus, the gradual upward shift from an anastomosing to a braided ?uvial style is ascribed to a climate change, and related increase in palaeorainfall. The existence of interstrati?ed illite?smectite clay minerals, mud cracks and caliche concretions within the ?ood plain deposits suggests deposition under a hot climate with alternating wet and dry seasons. Therefore, the results of this work show that the integration of facies studies with mineralogical and geochemical analysis enhances our ability to perform detailed paleoenvironmental studies on continental successions.},

  Abstract                 = {Classi?cation and ordination of plant formations are presented for a seasonally ?ooded plain of the Brazilian Pantanal. Phytosociological data were collected on 10 physiognomically distinct formations during the rainy, ?ood, and dry seasons. The degree of association among plant species was measured with Jaccard similarity index, and both Jaccard similarity index and Bray Curtis distance index were employed to classify sample units into similar groups. The ordination of plant species and sample units were performed with Correspondence Analysis. Four groups of plant formations were signi?cantly distinct on a quantitative basis: marsh ponds/waterlogged basins, short grasslands, tall grassland/scrub, and forest-edges. These formations were ordered along a gradient of topographic relief from depressions with permanent standing water (marshes) through ?ats subject to seasonal ?ooding (grasslands and scrub) and mounds of sandy soil above the ?ood level (forests). Although hydroperiod appears to be one of the most important variables, the distribution of plant species within wetlands is most probably explained by the interaction of many additional factors. A few plant species could be used as indicators of the local hydrological and edaphic conditions, e.g., Eleocharis elegans, Aeschynomene ?uminensis, Hydrolea spinosa, and Hymenachne amplexicaulis for marsh ponds, and Caperonia castaneifolia, Diodia kuntzei, and Eleocharis acutangula for waterlogged basins. The procedure presented in this study could be developed as a tool for the inventory and management of the Pantanal and other palustrine wetland habitats.},

  Abstract                 = {The soil survey includes a description of the morphological, physical and chemical properties of soils in a given area, including technical description and interdisciplinary information, and supporting various purposes. The digital soil mapping makes possible to improve the products of pedological surveys through the use of geographic information system (GIS) tools, and knowledge of the soil genesis, morphology and classification, in regards the choice of attributes that represent a consistent approach to the reality, and seeking to produce a precise soil survey with efficiency (cost x time). The overall objective of this study was to characterize the landscape components to subsidizethe prediction of soil classes, using artificial neural networks (ANN's), to produce the digital soil map of the Rio Guapi-Macacu watershed, located in Rio de Janeiro State. The mapping involved 100 sample points which were analysed for chemical and physical propertiesandmorphological described, according to standard soil surveys methods in Brazil. The digital soil mapping involved the acquisition ofcartographic database, creating digital models that represent landscape attributes relevant to pedogenesis and soil classification, analysis ofsoil-landscape relationships, and ultimately supervised classification by ANN and validation of the mapping result. Given the approach usedand the processing tools of the data available, the digital elevation models (DEM's) were analysed, for the spatial resolution and how to acquire the model, to select the appropriate DEM to derive the morphometric attributes. The analyses showed as having superior quality the DEM with appropriate spatial resolution of 30m cell size, obtained by interpolation of elevation data, contour lines and elevation points,SRTM sensor data. After defining the MDE and derivation of attributes, a study was made for recognition of patterns and geomorphic characterization of pedoenvironment involving sample collection and description of profiles in predefined locations, through theprogram Hypercube Latin Conditioned Sampling (cLHS). The predominant soils were: Oxisols, Ultisols, Inceptisols, Aquents and other Entisols.The usage of GIS tools allowed the selection of variables to compose sets of discriminants used in the classification stage by ANN. Theselected variables were: altimetry, slope, curvature, combined topographic index, euclidean distance, clay minerals, iron oxide, NDVI and geology. There were trained eleven sets of ANN's, with different combinations as to the discriminating variables (input layer). Thecriteria used in evaluating the performance of the ANN were the rates of overall accuracy and Kappa, considering the generalization of outputclasses. Validation was performed using 120 control points corresponding to the soil profiles that were not used for ANN training. Afterthe analysis of the mean square error of the different sets, the architecture with 10 hidden nodes was chosen. The evaluation criteria ofclassification underlined the best networks performance of the sets 1, 7 and 10, corresponding to all variables, excluding the geology, andexcluding the index NDVI, which did not differ. The generalization and validation showed that the set 10 allowed the best final classification.},

  Abstract                 = {The usual numerical methods for removing the depressions of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) gradually fill the depressions and merge the embedded ones. These methods are complex to implement and need large computation time, particularly when the DEM contains a high proportion of random noise. A new method is presented here. It is innovative because, instead of gradually filling the depressions, it first inundates the surface with a thick layer of water and then removes the excess water. The algorithm is simple to understand and to implement, requiring only a few tens of code lines. It is much faster than usual algorithms. Moreover, this method is versatile: depressions can be replaced with a surface either strictly horizontal, or slightly sloping. The first option is used for the calculation of depression storage capacity and the second one for drainage network extraction. The method is fully detailed and a pseudo-code is provided. Its practical computation time, evaluated on generated fractal surfaces, is asymptotically proportional to N1.2 where N is the number of grid points. The theoretical computation time is asymptotically proportional to N1.5 in all cases, with the exception of some exotic ones with no practical interest. By contrast, existing methods have a computation time asymptotically proportional to N2. Applications are done for both generated and measured surfaces with 256 cells to 6.2 million cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous research on the protection of soil organic C from decom-position suggests that soil texture affects soil C stocks. However, dif- ferent pools of soil organic matter (SOM) might be differently related to soil texture. Our objective was to examine how soil texture differ- entially alters the distribution of organic C within physically and chemi- cally defined pools of unprotected and protected SOM. We collected samples from two soil texture gradients where other variables influ- encing soil organic C content were held constant. One texture gradient (16?60% clay) was located near Stewart Valley, Saskatchewan, Canada and the other (25?50% clay) near Cygnet, OH. Soils were physically fractionated into coarse- and fine-particulate organic matter (POM), silt- and clay-sized particles within microaggregates, and easily dispersed silt- and clay-sized particles outside of microaggregates. Whole-soil organic C concentration was positively related to silt plus clay content at both sites. We found no relationship between soil texture and unprotected C (coarse- and fine-POM C). Biochemically protected C (nonhydrolyz- able C) increased with increasing clay content in whole-soil samples, but the proportion of nonhydrolyzable C within silt- and clay-sized fractions was unchanged. As the amount of silt or clay increased, the amount of C stabilized within easily dispersed and microaggregate- associated silt or clay fractions decreased. Our results suggest that for a given level of C inputs, the relationship between mineral surface area and soil organic matter varies with soil texture for physically and biochemically protected C fractions. Because soil texture acts directly and indirectly on various protection mechanisms, it may not be a uni- versal predictor of whole-soil C content.},

Further, humic acid (HA)-like fractions were isolated from the two substrates before and after the vermicomposting process, and analyzed for elemental and acidic functional group composition, and by ultraviolet/visible, Fourier transform infrared and fluorescence spectroscopies. Before vermicomposting, the HA-like fractions featured a prevalent aliphatic character, large C contents, small O and acidic functional group contents, a marked presence of proteinaceous materials and polysaccharide-like structures, extended molecular heterogeneity and small degrees of aromatic ring polycondensation, polymerisation and humification. After vermicomposting, the total extractable C and HA-C contents in the bulk substrates increased, and the C and H contents, aliphatic structures, polypeptidic components and carbohydrates decreased in the HA-like fractions, whereas O and acidic functional group contents increased. Further, an adequate degree of maturity and stability was achieved after vermincomposting, and the HA-like fractions, especially that from OP + CM, approached the characteristics typical of native soil HA. Vermicomposting was thus able to promote organic matter humification in both CM alone and in the mixture OP + CM, thus enhancing the quality of these materials as soil organic amendments.},

Nesse sentido, realizou-se a caracterização química e física de um Cambissolo Háplico Tb distrófico sob diferentes usos, no município de Visconde do Rio Branco, na Zona da Mata mineira. Foram avaliadas áreas com seringueira, laranja, cana, pastagem e mata. Seringueira, laranja e pastagem estão instaladas há 15 anos, e a cana, há 1,5 ano, sendo antes pastagem. Todos os usos agrícolas tiveram histórico com cana por aproximadamente 100 anos. A amostragem foi realizada em trincheiras, com três repetições, nas profundidades de 0 a 20 e 20 a 40 cm. Foram analisados as seguintes propriedades químicas: matéria orgânica do solo (MOS), pH em H 2 O, P, Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , Al 3+ , H + Al, SB, CTC efetiva (t), CTC a pH 7,0 (T), V, m e P-rem. As propriedades físicas analisadas foram: granulometria, densidade de partículas, densidade do solo, porosidade total, curva de retenção de água, resistência do solo à penetração e estabilidade de agregados em água, bem como as relações capacidade de água disponível/porosidade total (CAD/PT) e água retida na capacidade de campo/porosidade total (CC/PT). Os resultados demonstraram que o solo, em todos os usos, apresenta baixa fertilidade e caráter distrófico, com Al 3+ dominando o complexo de troca, com exceção do solo sob cana, que apresenta fertilidade média e teores negligenciáveis de Al 3+ trocável no complexo de troca. O uso agrícola do solo reduziu a MOS. As características físicas nos usos com seringueira e cana assemelharam-se às da mata, ao passo que laranja e pastagem mostraram degradação física, evidenciada pelos maiores valores de densidade e resistência do solo à penetração, e redução do espaço poroso e da estabilidade de agregados em água.},

  Abstract                 = {Burning pastures after the winter is a traditional practice in highland soils, whose main purpose is the regrowth of vegetation. However, the impact of fire, as well as the influence of grazing on the organic matter of Leptosols is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the composition and content of organic matter in soil profiles from São José dos Ausentes, state of Rio Grande do Sul, and to relate the results with the occurrence of burning and grazing, in comparison with a soil under native forest. The following environments were studied: grazed native pasture (2 animals ha -1 ) without burning for 22 years; grazed native pasture (0.5 animals ha -1 ) burned every two years; and native forest adjacent to the pasture area. Composed soil samples were collected from four layers (0?5, 5?10, 10?15 and 15? 30 cm) in which contents of C, of N, and of iron oxides (Fe d and Fe o ) were determined and infrared spectroscopy and thermogravimetry analyses performed. The subsurface layers of the fire-affected environment contained greater organic matter contents, and in general, a composition with higher proportion of chemically labile structures, in comparison with the unburned pasture. In the latter environment, the lower C content than in the burned pasture was ascribed to more intensive grazing. The C distribution in the native forest environment was similar to that of the unburned pasture. Nevertheless, in the samples under forest, the proportion of organic matter of low molecular weight, extractable with 0.1 mol L -1 HCl and related mainly to microbial activity, exceeded that of the pasture environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Quantitative risk assessment has emerged as a valuable tool to enhance the scientific basis of regulatory decisions in the food safety domain. This article introduces the use of two new computing resources (R packages) specifically developed to help risk assessors in their projects. The first package, #fitdistrplus#, gathers tools for choosing and fitting a parametric univariate distribution to a given dataset. The data may be continuous or discrete. Continuous data may be right-, left- or interval-censored as is frequently obtained with analytical methods, with the possibility of various censoring thresholds within the dataset. Bootstrap procedures then allow the assessor to evaluate and model the uncertainty around the parameters and to transfer this information into a quantitative risk assessment model. The second package, #mc2d#, helps to build and study two dimensional (or second-order) Monte-Carlo simulations in which the estimation of variability and uncertainty in the risk estimates is separated. This package easily allows the transfer of separated variability and uncertainty along a chain of conditional mathematical and probabilistic models. The usefulness of these packages is illustrated through a risk assessment of hemolytic and uremic syndrome in children linked to the presence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ground beef. These R packages are freely available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network (cran.r-project.org).},

  Abstract                 = {The transformation of landscapes from non-urban to urban land use has the potential to greatly modify soil carbon (C) pools and ?uxes. For urban ecosystems, very little data exists to assess whether urbanization leads to an increase or decrease in soil C pools. We analyzed three data sets to assess the potential for urbanization to a?ect soil organic C. These included surface (0?10 cm) soil C data from unmanaged forests along an urban?rural gradient, data from ??made?? soils (1 m depth) from ?ve di?erent cities, and surface (0?15 cm) soil data of several land-use types in the city of Baltimore. Along the urban?rural land-use gradient, we found that soil organic matter concentration in the surface 10 cm varied signi?cantly (P=0.001). In an analysis of variance, the urban forest stands had signi?cantly (P=0.02) higher organic C densities (kg m 2 to 1 m depth) than the suburban and rural stands. Our analysis of pedon data from ?ve cities showed that the highest soil organic C densities occurred in loamy ?ll (28.5 kg m 2 ) with the lowest occurring in clean ?ll and old dredge materials (1.4 and 6.9 kg m 2 , respectively). Soil organic C densities for residential areas (15.5  1.2 kg m 2 ) were consistent across cities. A comparison of land-use types showed that low density residential and institutional land-uses had 44 and 38% higher organic C densities than the commercial land-use type, respectively. Our analysis shows that as adjacent land-use becomes more urbanized, forest soil C pools can be a?ected even in stands not directly disturbed by urban land development. Data from several ??made?? soils suggests that physical disturbances and inputs of various materials by humans can greatly alter the amount C stored in these soils.},

  Abstract                 = {Volcanic soils constitute an important resource for agriculture and forestry in Central Mexico, as well as in various world regions. They exhibit unique properties and high productive potential related to the amorphous materials they contain. The relationship between amorphous materials, soil characteristic and functioning, has not been well studied. The objectives of the present work were to assess the influence of land use (agricultural and forest), topography and other soil forming factors on physical, chemical and mineralogical characteristics and pedological processes responsible for soil genesis and soil classification of two volcanic soil profiles derived from andesitic parent material located 150 m away from each other within the same toposequences. The toposequence is located in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB), a highly populated region of Central Mexico that provides part of the water for Mexico City megapolis. A series of field and laboratory techniques including physical, chemical, micromorphological, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), infra-red analysis, Mössbauer spectroscopy were used. The main factor affecting the present morphology of the soil profiles was the topography. The mineralogical features of the upper layers of the maize profile (Pachic Andosol), indicate redistribution of soil material from the upper part of the toposequence. The land use change favored this redistribution. Deeper horizons of this profile were developed from volcanic ashes deposited in situ. hematite and ferrihydrite, considered markers of evolution in redistributed soil material were observed in this profile associated with allophane. The presence of hematite has been reported for the first time in Mexican Andosols. The present characteristics of the forest profile (Dystric Cambisol) are mainly due to the pedological process of the volcanic ash layers remaining in situ after the redistribution and volcanic breccia. It was concluded that the forest profile evolved from an Andosol to an Inceptisol, which was evidenced by desaturation, loss of silica and organic carbon. In this profile the Fe minerals were associated with the presence of gibbsite and halloysite. The position in the toposequence and the physical and chemical characteristics of these profiles define their present functioning, such as losses by erosion and C dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Use of a single factor for converting soil organic carbon to soil organic matter is challenged. The basis for this challenge arises from four sources: the original papers published in the nineteenth century, empirical studies published throughout the twentieth century, theoretical considerations of organic matter composition, and a consideration of what led to the popularity and general acceptance of the conventional factor. The conventional factor of 1.724, based on the assumption that soil organic matter contains 58% carbon, applies only to some soils or only to particular components of soil organic matter. Studies published since the end of the nineteenth century have consistently shown that the factor of 1.724 is too low for most soils. In a review of previously published data, the median value for the conversion factor was found to be 1.9 from empirical studies and 2 from more theoretical considerations. A factor of 2, based on the assumption that organic matter is 50% carbon, would in almost all cases be more accurate than the conventional factor of 1.724. A consideration of the possible variation in organic matter composition predicts a range of factor values between 1.4 and 2.5, a range that is narrower than empirical results at least in part because of the interaction between the methods used to estimate organic matter and soil composition. Convenience, authority, and tradition rather than strength of evidence are in large part responsible for the widespread acceptance of the conventional factor.},

The method included the following steps: (a) field description of the TFS; (b) survey of local knowledge on both landscape and land qualities; (c) soil and maize grain yield sampling; and (d) statistical analyses relating local knowledge to field and laboratory data. A participatory approach was used; every field technique was carried out together with local producers. Statistical analyses of both field and laboratory data proved the consistency of peasant-defined land quality classes. Land quality was related to the distribution of available P, slope position and depth of recent volcanic ash cover. In addition, we detected a well-structured relief and soil quality knowledge-base. The TFS is a highly complex integrated scheme serving as a conceptual basis for decisionmaking procedures. The TFS does not attempt to maximize profit in cash. Its goal is self-sufficiency. These principles are at the core of decision-making procedures. The system represents a substantial part of the culture of Nuevo San Juan traditional producers. Family participation in the TFS is a key element; self-sufficiency gives security to the family. This explains the survival of the TFS despite its drawbacks, basically of a social nature rather than a technical nature.},

  Abstract                 = {The refractory (insoluble and resistant to drastic laboratory hydrolyses) organic macromolecular material (ROM), isolated from a sandy spodosol from Cestas (Landes de Gascogne, France), was examined via a combination of isotopic (? 13 C measurements), spectroscopic (FTIR and solid-state 13 C NMR) and pyrolytic (conventional pyrolysis and thermally assisted hydrolysis and methylation) methods. This soil was collected from a plot cleared 22years ago and since then continuously used for intensive maize cropping. The ROM of this cultivated soil was also compared to the ROM from the reference forest soil. It thus appeared that (i) the carbon of the ROM accounts for a substantial part (20%) of the total organic carbon of the cropped soil, (ii) the ROM shows a heterogeneous composition with contributions of altered lignin, polysaccharides, suberans, bacterial and higher plant fatty acids incorporated in the macromolecular structure, melanoidin-type components and suberin, (iii) extensive degradation of the ROM inherited from the forest soil (ca. two thirds) occurred upon cropping, a conspicuous uncoupling is thus observed between the resistance of this material to drastic laboratory hydrolyses (i.e. refractoriness) and its resistance to degradation under natural conditions, (iv) a low input of maize components took place in the ROM of the cropped soil so that, in spite of such a large degradation of the refractory carbon inherited from the forest soil, the latter is still predominant (ca. 85%) in this ROM, (v) differential degradation took place, upon cropping, in the ROM inherited from the forest soil: some components were eliminated (condensed alkyl lipids of higher plants, cellulosic units) or heavily degraded (other polysaccharides), a part of the lignin was retained but underwent side-chain oxidation, while increase in relative abundance was observed for suberin, melanoidins and suberans.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic matter (SOM) is a central contributor to soil quality as it mediates many of the chemical, physical, and biological processes controlling the capacity of a soil to perform successfully. SOM properties (e.g. C/N ratio, macro-organic matter) have been proposed as diagnostic criteria of overall soil fitness, but their use is hampered by a poor understanding of the basic biochemical principles underlying SOM processes. The objective of this project was to determine the influence of scrub oak (Quercus dumosa Nutt.) and Coulter pine (Pinus coulteri B. Don) vegetation on decomposition and SOM formation processes in a lysimeter installation constructed in 1936 in the San Gabriel mountains of southern California. Soil samples archived during construction of the installation, and A horizons sampled in 1987, were fractionated according to density and mineral particle size to isolate the water floatable (macro-organic matter), fine silt and clay fractions. Carbon turnover rates were determined on all fractions from AMS 14C measurements. Solid state CPMAS TOSS 13C NMR was used to semiquantitatively characterize the chemical structure of organic matter on fresh litter and soil fractions. For the two soils, there was a progressive decrease in O-alkyl C, and an increase in alkyl and carbonyl C from the litter to the floatable, fine silt and clay fractions. These compositional differences were due to the oxidative degradation of the litter material, with preferential decomposition of the cellulose and hemicellulose entities and selective preservation of recalcitrant waxes and resins. In all soil fractions, turnover rates of carbon were longer for the pine than for the oak lysimeter (up to 10 times longer). Also under pine, there was a gradual increase in turnover rate progressing from the floatable to the clay fraction, and differences in turnover rates among fractions may be explained based on differences in carbon chemistry. In contrast, under oak, rapid carbon turnover for all fractions suggested intense biological activity in this soil.},

The sensitivity of this index to flow path algorithm and grid size is examined for the case where the surface topography is a good indicator of local hydraulic gradients. A strategy for the case where downslope subsurface flow pathways may deviate from those indicated by the surface topography is described with an example application.},

This paper classi?es the MCMs and presents the mportant methods for each class. Both simulated and real data are used to compare methods, and emphasis is placed on correct application and interpretation. We include suggestions for choosing the best method. Mathematica programs developed by the authors are used to compare MCMs. By taking advantage of Mathematica?s notebook structure, an interested student can use these programs to explore the subject more deeply.

If it is a priori known or suspected that a subset of the covariates do not significantly contribute to the overall fit of the model, a restricted model that excludes these covariates, may be sufficient. If, on the other hand, the subset provides useful information, shrinkage method combines restricted and unrestricted estimators to obtain the parameter estimates. Such an estimator outperforms the classical maximum likelihood estimators. Any prior information may be validated through preliminary test (or pretest), and depending on the validity, may be incorporated in the model as a parametric restriction. Thus, pretest estimator chooses between the restricted and unrestricted estimators depending on the outcome of the preliminary test. Examples using three real life data sets are provided to illustrate the application of shrinkage and pretest estimation. Performance of positive-shrinkage and pretest estimators are compared with unrestricted estimator under varying degree of uncertainty of the prior information. Monte Carlo study reconfirms the asymptotic properties of the estimators available in the literature.},

Distributed models require not only accurate estimates but also their spatial distribution. The objective of this study was to use terrain and environmental variables to map these parameters, comparing different spatial prediction methods by their effect on simulated runoff hydrographs. The study area is called Faucon, located in south east of the French Alps. From amongst variables of “land cover class”, “lithologic units”, “elevation”, “LS factor”, “slope”, “aspect”, “wetness index”, “Overland flow distance to channel network”, “plan- profile curvature” and “convergence”, the “land cover class” was the best explanatory variable for soil thickness. None of the variables were good predictors for Ks. Also, An additive linear model of “land cover class” and “overland flow distance to channel network” best predicted soil thickness. Regression Kriging (RK) using this model and local spatial correlation of the residuals gave better accuracy than Ordinary Kriging (OK). These methods failed for Ks, so it was mapped by Thiessen polygons. The parameter maps, including conditional simulations of soil thickness, were exported to the hydrologic model of LISEM, where three synthetic rainfall scenarios were used. The hydrographs produced by RK and OK were significantly different at rainfall of low intensity or short duration but at rain events of longer duration or higher intensity, the hydrographs had no significant differences. The same results were obtained when simulated fields of soil thickness were applied in modelling. As a whole, the study revealed that RK of soil thickness represents better spatial variations than the OK. Also, various spatial patterns of soil thickness significantly influence simulated runoff at only rainfalls of low intensity and/or short duration.},

  Abstract                 = {The unsaturated soil hydraulic functions involving the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) and the hydraulic conductivity provide useful integrated indices of soil quality. Existing and newly devised methods were used to formulate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) that predict the SWRC from readily available soil data. The PTFs were calibrated using a large soils database from Hungary. The database contains measured soil-water retention data, the dry bulk density, sand, silt and clay percentages, and the organic matter content of 305 soil layers from some 80 soil profiles. A three-parameter van Genuchten type function was fitted to the measured retention data to obtain SWRC parameters for each soil sample in the database. Using a quasi-random procedure, the database was divided into “evaluation” (EVAL) and “test” (TEST) parts containing 225 and 80 soil samples, respectively. Linear PTFs for the SWRC parameters were calculated for the EVAL database. The PTFs used for this purpose particle-size percentages, dry bulk density, organic matter content, and the sand/silt ratio, as well as simple transforms (such as logarithms and products) of these independent variables. Of the various independent variables, the eight most significant were used to calculate the different PTFs. A nonlinear (NL) predictive method was obtained by substituting the linear PTFs directly into the SWRC equation, and subsequently adjusting the PTF parameters to all retention data of the EVAL database. The estimation error (SSQ) and efficiency (EE) were used to compare the effectiveness of the linear and nonlinearly adjusted PTFs. We found that EE of the EVAL and the TEST databases increased by 4 and 7%, respectively, using the second nonlinear optimization approach. To further increase EE, one measured retention data point was used as an additional (concomitant) variable in the PTFs. Using the 20 kPa water retention data point in the linear PTFs improved the EE by about 25% for the TEST data set. Nonlinear adjustment of the concomitant variable PTF using the 20 kPa retention data point as concomitant variable produced the best PTF. This PTF produced EE values of 93 and 88% for the EVAL and TEST soil data sets, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {A short general review of all aspects of the NMR technique, in both the spectroscopic and imaging modes, as applied to the study of soil, is presented from a mainly technical point of view. Illustrations, in the form of spectra and images, are reproduced for whole soils, solids, solid fractions, and liquid extracts from material in the authors' group. Nuclides covered are 1H, 13C, 15N, 27Al and 31P. For solid samples the techniques employed include CP/MAS with and without TOSS, and for liquid-state studies the first high field (14.1 T) examples for soils in both one and two frequency dimensions are presented. For imaging further results from the first application of the stray field (STRAFI) technique applied to water in soil are given showing distortion-free images of both bound and free water. Finally, the first electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) and pulsed EPR results on soils will be illustrated. This paper is a slightly expanded version of an introductory talk of 35 minutes and so is not discursive. In particular the benefits of the techniques presented to soil science are only touched on. Other speakers present papers elsewhere in this issue which expand on particular aspects of the utility of NMR studies of soils},

  Abstract                 = {Measuring particle-size distribution (psd) is so time-consuming and expensive that it is rarely affordable for systematic survey. In young soil dominated by silicate minerals the size fractions have characteristic elemental compositions, and so they might be predicted from geochemical analysis. We tested the feasibility of predicting the psd from concentrations of elements in samples of topsoil taken in surveys of two large regions in eastern England and on which the psd had been determined. Of the 35 elements measured we chose eight (a) from our general knowledge of mineral composition, (b) after a principal component analysis to avoid redundancy and (c) experience elsewhere. Of the eight elements, five were used (Al, Fe, Ni, Ti and Zr) to build multiple linear regression models for the predictions. The equations were assessed by their coefficients of determination, R2, and the effectiveness of their predictions, expressed as rootmean- square errors (RMSEs) on validation sets of data of known psd. The models accounted on average for 89% of the variance in the clay size-fraction and 82% for sand. The corresponding median RMSEs were 4.9% and 8.8% on medians of 17% and 58%, respectively. The silt size-fraction was less well predicted; R2 was only 0.58, and the median RMSE was 10.6% on a median of 22%. We judge our approach, in which the regression models may be regarded as pedotransfer functions, to have been moderately successful and to merit attention in similar circumstances in other regions.},

Soil weathering processes were characterized by solum depth, texture, and Ca:Zr chemical weathering indices. Quartz and mica were used to identify eolian additions to the volcanic soils. Accelerated rates of weathering and soil development were found to occur in soils on south-facing slopes while no trend with aspect was found for eolian additions.

  Abstract                 = {Some scientists argue, with reference to Popper's scientific philosophical school, that models cannot be verified or validated. Other scientists and many practitioners nevertheless use these terms, but with very different meanings. As a result of an increasing number of examples of model malpractice and mistrust to the credibility of models, several modelling guidelines are being elaborated in recent years with the aim of improving the quality of modelling studies. This gap between the views and the lack of consensus experienced in the scientific community and the strongly perceived need for commonly agreed modelling guidelines is constraining the optimal use and benefits of models. This paper proposes a framework for quality assurance guidelines, including a consistent terminology and a foundation for a methodology bridging the gap between scientific philosophy and pragmatic modelling. A distinction is made between the conceptual model, the model code and the site-specific model. A conceptual model is subject to confirmation or falsification like scientific theories. A model code may be verified within given ranges of applicability and ranges of accuracy, but it can never be universally verified. Similarly, a model may be validated, but only with reference to site-specific applications and to pre-specified performance (accuracy) criteria. Thus, a model's validity will always be limited in terms of space, time, boundary conditions and types of application. This implies a continuous interaction between manager and modeller in order to establish suitable accuracy criteria and predictions associated with uncertainty analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Although uncertainty about structures of environmental models (conceptual uncertainty) is often acknowledged to be the main source of uncertainty in model predictions, it is rarely considered in environmental modelling. Rather, formal uncertainty analyses have traditionally focused on model parameters and input data as the principal source of uncertainty in model predictions. The traditional approach to model uncertainty analysis, which considers only a single conceptual model, may fail to adequately sample the relevant space of plausible conceptual models. As such, it is prone to modelling bias and underestimation of predictive uncertainty. In this paper we review a range of strategies for assessing structural uncertainties in models. The existing strategies fall into two categories depending on whether field data are available for the predicted variable of interest. To date, most research has focussed on situations where inferences on the accuracy of a model structure can be made directly on the basis of field data. This corresponds to a situation of ‘interpolation’. However, in many cases environmental models are used for ‘extrapolation’; that is, beyond the situation and the field data available for calibration. In the present paper, a framework is presented for assessing the predictive uncertainties of environmental models used for extrapolation. It involves the use of multiple conceptual models, assessment of their pedigree and reflection on the extent to which the sampled models adequately represent the space of plausible models. },

  Abstract                 = {A compactação do solo é um problema antigo e intensificou-se com a modernização da agricultura, principalmente pelo uso de máquinas cada vez maiores e mais pesadas. A compactação em áreas agrícolas e em pastagens ocorre, geralmente, em uma camada encontrada até, no máximo, a 20 cm, enquanto, em áreas florestais, a compactação pode atingir maiores profundidades. No plantio convencional, essa camada compactada era rompida pelos implementos de preparo do solo, transferindo a compactação para maiores profundidades pelo tráfego e contato dos implementos com o solo subsuperficial. No sistema plantio direto ou em pastagens, como não há revolvimento, a compactação do solo fica mais restrita à sua superfície. Em áreas florestais, com o possível revolvimento do solo (2) a compactação é eliminada até à camada de ação dos implementos, porém, em áreas sob condução de rebrota, a compactação permanece. O estudo da compactação é complexo, pois, assim como os solos (Braida, 2004; Silva et al., 2006b,c), as culturas também respondem diferentemente à compactação do solo (Foloni et al., 2006). As culturas da soja, milho, algodão e Brachiaria brizantha responderam diferentemente quanto à área foliar, produção de matéria seca da parte aérea e altura em relação aos níveis de compactação, representados pela densidade de um Latossolo Vermelho-Escuro distrófico (569 g kg -1 de areia, 90 g kg -1 de silte e 341 g kg -1 de argila) em vaso (Silva et al., 2006a). Portanto, as decisões a serem tomadas em relação ao manejo do solo devem ser, muitas vezes, específicas a cada situação. Em função disso, há necessidade de estudar a compactação em diferentes solos, culturas, variedades e condições climáticas.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of degree of compactness (DC), referred to as field bulk density (BD) as a percentage of a reference bulk density (BDref), was developed to characterize compactness of soil frequently disturbed, but for undisturbed soil such as under no-tillage critical degree of compactness values have not been tested. The objective of this study was to compare methods to determine BDref and limits of DC and BD for plant growth under no-tillage in subtropical soils. Data from the literature and other databases were used to establish relationships between BD and clay or clay plus silt content, and between DC and macroporosity and yield of crops under no-tillage in subtropical Brazil. Data of BDref reached by the soil Proctor test on disturbed soil samples, by uniaxial compression with loads of 200 kPa on disturbed and undisturbed soil samples, and 400, 800 and 1600 kPa on undisturbed soil samples, were used. Also, comparisons were made with critical bulk density based on the least limiting water range (BDc LLWR) and on observed root and/or yield restriction in the field (BDc Rest). Using vertical uniaxial compression with a load of 200 kPa on disturbed or undisturbed samples generates low BDref and high DC-values. The standard Proctor test generates higher BDref-values, which are similar to those in a uniaxial test with a load of 1600 kPa for soils with low clay content but lower for soils with high clay content. The BDc LLWR does not necessarily restrict root growth or crop yield under no-tillage, since field investigations led to higher BDc Rest-values. A uniaxial load greater than 800 kPa is promising to determine BDref for no-tillage soils. The BDref is highly correlated to the clay content and thus pedotransfer functions may be established to estimate the former based on the latter. Soil ecological properties are affected before compaction restricts plant growth and yield. The DC is an efficient parameter to identify soil compaction affecting crops. The effect of compaction on ecological properties must also be further considered.},

A Resolução Conama 397/2008 permite a eliminação do limite para efluentes sanitários.

Soil physical properties are recognized for their important role in supporting plant growth. To identify the effects of landscape attributes on soil physical properties the present study collected and analysed information from air photos, satellite images, field survey, and the laboratory using statistical analyses. Land stratification allowed the study area to be subdivided into Land Unit Tracts (LUT), according to specified criteria including landform attributes (slope, aspect, and altitude) and vegetation type. A factorial model on the basis of a completely randomised design was used to analyse the data collected from 234 LUT. The interrelationships between soil physical properties and landscape attributes were investigated and interpreted based on statistical analysis and expert knowledge. Slope significantly ( Pb0.05) affected most properties of the 0? 10 cm topsoil including grade of pedality and slake test. Also, many soil properties that reflect parent material and likely to be related to soil moisture status including coarse fragment ratio, soil profile effective thickness, first layer effective thickness, water retention capacity, and depth to water table were significantly related to slope gradient. These soil properties noticeably affect range productivity.},

  Abstract                 = {O teor de C orgânico total do solo (COT) pode ser determinado por métodos que se baseiam nos princípios de combustão a seco e combustão úmida. Ambos apresentam inconvenientes, principalmente o de combustão úmida, que exige grande quantidade de reagentes, gerando, por conseqüência, alta quantidade de resíduos tóxicos que contêm Cr. O método denominado Mebius no bloco de digestão (Mebius no bloco) permite a diminuição do uso de dicromato de potássio em análises de solo. Nesse sentido, o presente estudo objetivou verificar a precisão e exatidão do método Mebius no bloco em relação a outros de combustão úmida e o de combustão a seco. O trabalho foi realizado na Federal University of Santa Maria, em duas etapas: os teores de COT foram determinados em 18 amostras de duas camadas (0?5 e 5?10 cm) de um Latossolo Vermelho distrófico típico com diferentes usos. Os métodos usados foram Walkley-Black, Mebius modificado, Mebius no bloco e por captura de CO 2 ; os teores de COT foram determinados por combustão a seco e Mebius no bloco em 75 amostras coletadas nos horizontes A1 (0?7,5 e 7,5?15 cm), A2, E e Bt de um Argissolo Vermelho-Amarelo distrófico abrúptico submetido a cinco sistemas de manejo e três repetições. A precisão apresentada pelos métodos de combustão úmida é similar e com coeficiente de variação abaixo de 10 %, com exceção do método de captura de CO 2 , que apresentou valores de COT inferiores aos dos demais e com maior coeficiente de variação. O método Mebius no bloco permite processar maior número de amostras por tempo, com menor consumo de reagentes, e seus resultados apresentam boa precisão (coeficiente de variação menor que 2,60 %) entre os métodos de combustão úmida testados. Um fator de correção de 1,14 deverá ser aplicado aos resultados obtidos pelo método Mebius no bloco para equivaler aos obtidos por combustão a seco (analisador elementar de carbono).},

  Abstract                 = {In the marginally productive rangelands of the semiarid, southwest-ern USA, the maintenance of organic C (OC) is essential to the stability of the ecosystem. This study was conducted to identify landscape factors responsible for the distribution of OC in watershed soils, its loss from upland areas and subsequent transport within the stream system of a large semiarid watershed (Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed [WGEW], Tombstone, AZ). Samples were collected along transects from the surface 5 cm of each major soil mapping unit in six subwater- sheds (SW). Data were recorded for slope class, landscape position, and aspect at each of the 435 sampling points. Soil analyses consisted of: total C and OC, particle-size distribution, water dispersible clay, pH, quantitative color, and aggregation index (AI). Sediment samples were collected from flumes at each SW outlet. These 169 bedload and 59 suspended sediment samples were analyzed identically to the soils. Soil data indicated that OC distributions in the SWs were related to parent material with significantly (p # 0.05) greater contents recorded on the steeper slopes (.9%), and backslope and toeslope positions. Fewer significant correlations were identified for aspect. Soil OC was signifi- cantly (p # 0.01) correlated with silt and clay contents. Organic C contents of the soils and suspended sediments averaged 11.4 and 24.0 g kg 21 , respectively, giving an enrichment ratio (ER) for OC in the suspended sediments of 2.13. Bedload sediment was depleted in OC by an average ratio of 0.65 relative to the soils. The results suggest that OC is transported through this watershed predominantly as silt- and clay-size materials in concentrations controlled by the soil AI.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear Regression Analysis (LRA) is one of the statistical tools most intensively used in all branches of science, with many applications in the study of measurement processes and is therefore important in metrology. The implementation of metrology in quality systems, led to a widespread evaluation of measurement uncertainties based on the GUM uncertainty framework (Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement). This methodology, however, has its own restrictions among which one could include the use of LRA in multi-stage measurement. To overcome these restrictions, an alternative approach considers the use of the Monte Carlo method to evaluate LRA uncertainties and, subsequently, to use it further in the evaluation of uncertainties in multi-stage measurement processes.

  Abstract                 = {Although nearly three decades of widespread use have confirmed the reliability of the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), very little work has been done to assess the error associated with it. This study was conducted to develop a set of statistics that would measure the performance of the USLE. Estimates of soil loss using the USLE were compared with measured values on 208 natural runoff plots, representing >1700 plot years of data, to assess the error associated with the USLE predictions. The overall Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency was determined to be 0.75 on an average annual basis and 0.58 when compared on a yearly basis. The USLE overpredicted soil loss on plots with low erosion rates while the plots with higher rates were underpredicted. Of the USLE parameters, the topographic factor (LS) and the cover and management factor (C) had the most influence on the model efficiency. Confidence intervals for USLE predictions were developed and showed that the accuracy of the USLE in terms of percentage difference between predicted and expected values increases with increasing values of total soil loss. It was also shown that there was no significant difference between the average magnitude of error for pre- and post-1960 data sets and that the use of rainfall and runoff factor (R) values instead of calculated erosion index (EI) values resulted in a drop in model efficiency of 0.02. One must use caution in applying the results of this error analysis to conditions in which they may not be applicable, due to the limited nature of this data set.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurately evaluating the available soil water reservoir is vital to developing optimum management for rainfed crop production in marginally dry regions. However, the soil water reservoir is not like a bucket. Some water may percolate down out of the root zone under the influence of gravity or other forces. All water remaining in the root zone reservoir cannot be taken up by the plant as rapidly as needed because it is held too tightly by the soil particles. Much attention has been given to problems of available water limits through- out the history of physical soil science. During the past four decades, the traditional approach to evaluating the limits of available water has been to measure the 'wilting point' and 'field capacity' of soil samples removed from the field through use of pressure chambers, usually measuring soil water contents at potentials of - 15 bar for the wilting point and - 0 . 3 3 bar or - 0 . 1 0 bar for field capacity. Samples are taken from the soil at various depths to the measured or estimated rooting depth and the difference between the upper and lower limits of availability are summed over the rooting depth to determine the total plant available water.},

  Abstract                 = {Producing a preliminary cartographic sketch of soil-forming factors is required by pedologists while preparing their ground survey. With this aim, we define #soilscapes# (pédopaysages) as complex spatial objects observable at a determined spatial resolution and potentially recognisable by an original composition of landscape elements, the co-occurrence and topological relationships of these elements or the size of their spatial pattern. The proposed approach describes each point to be mapped by characteristics of its spatial neighbourhood and allocates it to pre-defined reference classes using a mathematical distance. The result is a numeric dashboard with continuous and crisp maps, graphs and cartographic and statistical quality indicators. An application example presents a small-scale cartographic sketch, as required by a French inventory program (Inventaire, Gestion et Conservation des Sols de France, IGCS), delineating soilscape units on a 50,000-ha area of southern France from 50-m resolution lithological map and topographical derivatives. A satisfactory agreement is found with an existing soilscape map made by trained surveyors. Such an approach intends to be a quantitative, iterative and interactive tool in order to (1) model the pattern of soil-forming factors in a generic, explicit and reproducible way, and (2) enrich and hasten the field work.},

In this paper I suggest an approach for assessing the significance of peaks in the surface that result from the application of the smoothing kernel. The approach may also be thought of as a method for assessing the maximum among a set of suitably defined local statistics. Local statistics for data on a regular grid of cells are first defined by using a Gaussian kernel. Results from integral geometry are then used to find the probability that the maximum local statistic (M) exceeds a given critical value (M). Approximations are provided that make implementation of the approach straightforward. Future work will address several other issues associated with local statistics that have been defined in this way, including edge effects, and the effects of global spatial autocorrelation on the choice of critical value.},

  Abstract                 = {The widespread popularity of geographic information systems (GIS) has led to new insights in countless areas of application. It has facilitated not only the collection and storage of geographic data, but also the display of such data. Building on this progress by using an integrated approach, Statistical Detection and Monitoring of Geographic Clusters provides the statistical tools to identify whether data on a given map deviates significantly from expectations and to determine quickly whether new point patterns are emerging over time. The book begins with a review of statistical methods for cluster detection, organized according to the different types of hypotheses and questions about clustering that can be investigated. It then delineates methods that allow for the quick detection of emergent geographic clusters. The book delivers a cohesive presentation unlike that of most edited volumes. Drawing on the authors' extensive work in the field, the book delineates methods in such a way that they can be applied, almost instantly, to an array of disciplines. The readily applicable methods the book describes are useful for a multitude of problems in a variety of fields, particularly disease surveillance in the public health industry.

  Abstract                 = {In recent years thematic mapping has undergone a revolution as the result of advances in geographic information science and remote sensing. However, mapping of soil types and characteristics has not fully shared in this revolution, because of the complexity of soil geography and the high cost of its direct observation. None the less, the demand for soil information has never been higher, since the soil resource is so important for rural and urban planning, for environmental protection, and to understand water and geochemical cycles. This paper reviews the advances which are leading towards multiple-use soil information systems. These advances include: (1) low-cost, wide-area data, especially elevations and spectral reﬂectances; (2) direct digital remote sensing of soil properties; (3) geostatistical interpolation and sampling design; (4) terrain modelling; (5) predictive soil mapping; (6) data integration; (7) pedotransfer functions and soil inference systems; (8) powerful desktop computing environments; (9) the Internet. The challenge is to integrate these advances into operational systems that respond to the extensive actual and latent demand for soil information.},

  Abstract                 = {of organic matter with increasing degree of humi?cation was examined using four horizons of a forest humus pro?le. The aim was to determine whether HF treatment alters pristine organic matter or not. The conceptual approach included elemental and isotopic analyses of the L, Of, Oh and Ah horizons of a Dystric Cambisol under forest before and after treatment with 2% and 10% HF. The chemical composition of the bulk organic matter was analysed using 13 C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared (IR) spectroscopy and pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The lignin and non-cellulosic sugar components were characterised by wet chemical analysis. Carbon loss after HF treatment was between 7% and 23% of initial C and nitrogen loss between 14% and 27% of initial N. The HF concentration (2% and 10%) in?uenced the C and N concentration of the HF residue but in most cases not the C and N loss. No change in the isotopic signatures (d 13 C and d 15 N) were apparent. The bulk chemical composition as seen by 13 C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy did not change after HF treatment. (FTIR) spectra of organic horizons were also not a?ected but analysis of organic matter of mineral rich Oh and Ah horizons became possible only after the treatment. These two meth- ods were not sensitive enough to record changes in OM composition induced by the HF treatment. Pyrolysis GC/MS showed, in agreement with the wet chemical analysis of non-cellulosic sugars, that some change occurred in the quantity and compo- sition of these saccharides. Lignin analysis suggested that some changes occurred in the composition of the molecule.},

  Abstract                 = {Mounting evidence shows that soil surveyors can learn a great deal from traditional farmers. Most studies of local soil knowledge, however, focus on unique cultural groups with centuries of accumulated knowledge of their environmental surroundings. Many farmers in the developing world are non-indigenous peasants who do not benefit from a rich cultural tradition. This paper examines peasant agriculture and awareness of soil in the Central Cordillera of the Dominican Republic. Information on soils was extracted from a geo-coded environmental database compiled by the Dominican Republic?s State Secretariat for Agriculture and processed to produce site suitability ratings for six land uses (coffee, beans, grazing, pigeon peas, garlic, and rice). Farmer information dealing with environmental perception, agricultural technology, and agricultural decision-making factors was obtained in a field survey of 80 farmers. Survey statistics on technology were used to derive a numerical index of modern agricultural technology while factors conditioning choice of principal enterprise were examined using point score analysis. It is shown that peasant farmers in the Dominican Republic use a blend of modern and traditional methods that is neither productive nor ecologically sensitive. In addition, their soil taxonomy is comparatively unsophisticated. On the other hand, this study demonstrates that their empirical knowledge of site suitability is of great value for verification of scientific site suitability ratings derived from parametric indices. It is concluded that the participatory approach to agricultural research and development is particularly relevant in soil survey.},

  Abstract                 = {Many scientific phenomena are now investigated by complex computer models or codes. A computer experiment is a number of runs of the code with various inputs. A feature of many computer experiments is that the output is deterministic--rerunning the code with the same inputs gives identical observations. Often, the codes are computationally expensive to run, and a common objective of an experiment is to fit a cheaper predictor of the output to the data. Our approach is to model the deterministic output as the realization of a stochastic process, thereby providing a statistical basis for designing experiments (choosing the inputs) for efficient prediction. With this model, estimates of uncertainty of predictions are also available. Recent work in this area is reviewed, a number of applications are discussed, and we demonstrate our methodology with an example.},

In this paper, the Hillslope Erosion Model (HEM) was applied to predict the sediment yield from two sets of plots that represented open grazing and manually harvested treatments in Talesh rangelands, Guilan Province, Iran. The model performance was evaluated by comparing predicted and measured sediment yield in standard plots resulting from 24 natural rainfall events. The results showed that the calibration of the default value of erodibility parameter did not improve the initial efficacy of the model, while the development of an appropriate regression function was required to obtain accurate estimates on sediment yield from the study plots. The results of the analyses showed the potential of the model to predict sediment yield for the open grazing and cultivated treatments with coefficients of determination of 0.96 and 0.98, and estimation errors of 20.78% and 47.00%, respectively. The predicted results therefore showed that the HEM could be used as a major tool to estimate sediment yield at plot scale in rangelands.},

  Abstract                 = {Sodium affected rice (Oryza sativa L.)-cropped fields are very common. Due to their high exchangeable Na percentage, clay dispersion is one of the major risks for these soils when they are flooded. During flooding, Fe2+ may become a major cation due to reductive dissolution of Fe oxides, but the flocculation effect of Fe2+ is not known. In this paper, the effect of Fe2+ on clay flocculation is studied by establishing critical coagulation concentration (CCC) curves of days extracted from a paddy soil of Northeast Thailand. The effect of Na-Fe2+ and Na-Ca electrolytes on the CCC values is compared for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) values ranging from 0 to 40 and total electrolyte concentration (TEC) ranging from 0.5 to 10 mmol L-1. The extracted day is a mixture of kaolinite and smectite but only the smectite and some poorly ordered kaolinite could be dispersed. The CCC values largely reflected the behavior of smectite, in agreement with previous studies. The CCC values were equal for electrolytes with Fe2+ or Ca2+ cations, suggesting that Fe2+strongly adsorbs on smectite exchange sites and behaves similarly to Ca2+. The Fe2+ concentration needed to flocculate the clays was at maximum 0.6 mmol L-1 for the most dispersive electrolytes, which is a common concentration in flooded rice fields. Reductive dissolution of Fe can protect sodic soils from clay dispersion upon flooded rice cropping.},

  Abstract                 = {13 C CP-MAS NMR spectroscopy is a technique that has proved to be useful in studying soil organic matter (SOM). Nevertheless, NMR spectra exhibit a weak signal and have very low resolution due to: the low natural abundance of 13 C (1.1 % of C) in SOM, the generally low SOM content of soils, and the presence of paramagnetic impurities. This paper studies the effects of soil chemical pre-treatments on 13 CP-MAS NMR spectra quality and spectra representativity i.e. soil C mass balance. After chemical pre-treatment to increase total organic carbon (TOC) content and C/Fe ratio, eight soils characterized by different levels of organic carbon content and C/Fe ratios were studied using 13 CP-MAS NMR. Moreover, where chemical treatments were not applicable due to high carbon losses, the number of 13 CP-MAS NMR scans was increased in order to obtain satisfactory spectra. Results show that chemical pre-treatment of soils with C/Fe > 1 caused high C losses. Bulk soils were therefore studied by increasing the number of 13 CP-MAS NMR scans. Acceptable spectra were obtained from 8K scans (1K = 1024 transient). On the other hand, even when a large number of scan (32K) are used, soil with C/Fe < 1 cannot be studied. As these soils are characterized by low C losses after HCl treatments (range of 2.9?25.4%), a pre-treatment of at least 1.39 mol l-1 HCl removes excess Fe and at the same time increases C/Fe ratio resulting in 32K scans providing good spectra.},

  Abstract                 = {The concept of diversity and its measurement is becoming increasingly attractive to soil scientists. This theme is explored using a terrace chronosequence in the Henares River valley, NE Madrid. Pedodiversity was computed at different hierarchical levels (Great Group, Subgroup and family of Soil Taxonomy) using appropriate indices including abundance and the Shannon diversity index. Taxonomic pedodiversity, i.e., the diversity of soil types, increased with time (from low to high terraces) at high hierarchical levels but no clear relationship was found at family level. Richness-area analysis showed that a logarithmic function fitted data from the low and middle terraces, while the high terrace data could be fitted with a power model. The geostatistical analysis revealed a decrease in the variability of soil properties from young to old deposits. This study showed that, at the Henares site, diversity and spatial variability of soil properties are not synonymous concepts. Indeed, the terrace with the highest taxonomic pedodiversity at Great Group and Subgroup levels, showed a lowspatial variability of soil properties. Also, the same terrace exhibited the lowest connectance values. A non-linear dynamical system approach can be useful to explain these apparently contradictory results.},

  Abstract                 = {Quality of soil maps is a prerequisite for rational land use and soil management. To assess the accuracy of the existing reconnaissance soil map (1:50,000) of the Chaharmahal Bakhtiari province, Iran, a second-order soil survey was conducted. Using aerial photo interpretation, profile description, and field observations, a detailed soil map (1:20,000) was prepared. Then, 85 pedons were described and samples were taken for laboratory analyses. The location of pedons was determined with a Global Positioning System (GPS) and then marked on both soil maps using ILWIS software. Properties of the surface horizons including percentage of gravel, clay, sand, silt, CaCO3 equivalent, organic matter, and the thickness of A horizon were determined. Although detailed soil map units were more homogenous, purity of map units at family and series levels was lower than those expected in American Soil Survey Manual. Taxonomic purity at series level was 18.75% to 33.3% and 0% to 1.3% for detailed and reconnaissance soil maps, respectively. With respect to similar soils, interpretive purity could improve to 75% in detailed soil map. For all the surface soil properties except organic matter, the detailed soil map had within-map unit variances that were smaller than the total variance, whereas reconnaissance soil map variance remained high. Soil classification in both the detailed and the reconnaissance mapping units accounted for 5% to 45% and 1.1% to 27% of the total variance for these properties. Sampling demand to predict mean values was much larger in the reconnaissance soil map for most of the topsoil properties. Laboratory studies showed that the detailed soil map units in similar physiographic units could have different soils and vice versa. It appears that the definition of mapping units based on guidelines by Soil Survey Manual is rather optimistic and does not have sufficient reliability for using in sustainable agriculture.},

  Abstract                 = {We explore the tasks where sensitivity analysis (SA) can be useful and try to assess the relevance of SA within the modeling process. We suggest that SA could considerably assist in the use of models, by providing objective criteria of judgement for different phases of the model-building process: model identification and discrimination; model calibration; model corroboration. We review some new global quantitative SA methods and suggest that these might enlarge the scope for sensitivity analysis in computational and statistical modeling practice. Among the advantages of the new methods are their robustness, model independence and computational convenience. The discussion is based on worked examples.},

  Abstract                 = {Is it possible to build predictive models (PMs) of soil particle-size distribution (psd) in a region with complex geology and a young and unstable land-surface? The main objective of this study was to answer this question. A set of 339 soil samples from a small slope catchment in Southern Brazil was used to build PMs of psd in the surface soil layer. Multiple linear regression models were constructed using terrain attributes (elevation, slope, catchment area, convergence index, and topographic wetness index). The PMs explained more than half of the data variance. This performance is similar to (or even better than) that of the conventional soil mapping approach. For some size fractions, the PM performance can reach 70 %. Largest uncertainties were observed in geologically more complex areas. Therefore, significant improvements in the predictions can only be achieved if accurate geological data is made available. Meanwhile, PMs built on terrain attributes are efficient in predicting the particle-size distribution (psd) of soils in regions of complex geology.},

A sequência que melhor representa essas mudanças é: lavoura pecuáriacapoeira  floresta. Os solos das áreas ocupadas por floresta natural são pedregosos e rasos, ao contrário das áreas sob cultivo. Isso indica que mapas de uso da terra devem ser utilizados na predição de características do solo em trabalhos de mapeamento digital. Além disso, as imagens disponibilizadas pelo aplicativo Google Earth Pro permitiram a discriminação adequada das classes de uso da terra, devendo ser utilizadas em trabalhos com essa finalidade.

Their properties and taxonomic status were evaluated in relation to Spodosols of other maritime regions. Oxalate-extractable Al concentrations (10?70 g kg?1) are comparable to those in podzolized soils containing tephra. Free Fe concentrations exceed 35 g kg?1 in most Bhs horizons, with approximately half in crystalline forms. Oxalate-extractable Si concentrations suggest a substantial allophane content in some Bhs horizons. Maximum C concentrations (110?180 g kg?1) occur at 0.5- to 2.0-m depth above root restricting layers or in channel-like features initiated by tree roots. The maximum organic C content (170 g kg?1) allowed by the Canadian classification for mineral soil horizons may be too restrictive. Clay concentrations are high enough to exclude some pedons of podzolic morphology from the Spodosols of the U.S. system of soil taxonomy. Adoption of a required (Alp + Fep)/clay ratio lower than the current minimum of 0.2 for spodic horizons in the U.S. system would provide a more realistic classification of these soils.},

  Abstract                 = {Unsuitable land use worldwide has led to environmental degradation. Land use effects on the environmental component of soil quality were assessed in 47 benchmark soils of three natural environments (Xerolls, Xerepts, and Cryepts) in southern Spain. Within each environment, soil groups with traditional land uses were compared with native sites. Soil quality changes were inferred by measuring the relative changes in chemical and physical soil properties. Irrigated terraces, rainfed cropland, and grassland, all within Xerepts, and grazed thyme scrub land were degraded with respect to native sites (significant differences at P < 0.05). In all cases, total porosity, macroporosity, and cation exchange capacity declined by more than 18% (?0.11 cm3 cm?3), 30% (?0.11 cm3 cm?3), and 48% [?10.5 cmol(+) kg?1], respectively. Except in irrigated terraces, soil erodibility increased by as much as 59% (+0.16 USLE factor). Substantial losses of soil organic C (37%, ?14.7 Mg ha?1), available water (52%, ?36.2 mm), total N (65%, ?1.7 Mg ha?1), and rooting depth (68%, ?39 cm) were also observed in grassland and thyme scrub land. These changes suggest adverse effects on environmental protection functions of soil because of soil compaction and/or elimination of structural binding agents. Scanning electron microscopy images confirmed these morphological changes in microaggregates. Similar changes did not occur in cropland and grassland within Cryepts or in planted pine forest land. Reforestation with pine (Pinus nigra Arnold, Pinus sylvestris L., and Pinus uncinata Mill. ex Mirb.) provided organic cements and fungal hyphae that reinforce soil aggregation as well as ecologically valuable humus. Because cropland and grassland were able to recover the natural soil properties without human activity, we deduce that Cryepts are resilient.},

Due to this fact, it was carried out a survey of the papers published in the Pesquisa AgropecuÆria Brasileira - PAB journal from 1980 to 1994 in which some type of ACT was used. The objective of this paper was to point up the growing problems of the indiscriminate use of the ACT applied to the statistical analysis in the papers published in this journal. The study was carried out using 628 papers, and the ACT were classified in the following categories: appropriate, not appropriate and parcially appropriate. As a consequence of this study, it was found that 57.01%, 31.53% and 11.46% of the surveyed papers applied the appropriate, not appropriate and parcially appropriate ACT, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {We demonstrate that the pedogenic understanding raster classification (PURC) approach can be transferred to a new soil survey project area and that classification tree analysis is a viable alternative to a knowledge-based decision tree for predicting the distribution of soil classes. The new area is in the Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA, which has greater variability in parent material, lower erosion rates and a colder climate than the Powder River Basin of Johnson County, Wyoming, where the PURC approach was developed. There is also a lack of existing soil survey data within or adjacent to the new study area. Topographic data derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) and various band combinations and ratios of Landsat 7 remotely sensed spectral data were selected to represent soil-forming factors. Unsupervised classification techniques were used in the preliminary stage of the methodology to recognise existing soil-landscape patterns and to develop an initial sampling plan. Knowledge-based classification and classification tree analysis were used to develop models predicting soil delineations and quantifying soil map unit concepts. The output images generated from the knowledge-based and classification tree models produced similar predictions of soil patterns across the landscape, with slightly different predictions of soil map units. However, the knowledge-based model was much more time-intensive than the classification trees, and failed to classify all pixels within the study area even after multiple iterations of the model. Classification tree analysis was successfully integrated into the methodology, and is more objective than the knowledge-based classification. Although finals maps were slightly different, both models were transparent and could be further refined as additional data becomes available or as land-use needs change.},

First, the various statistical measures used in this journal are summarized and their interrelationships described by way of a flow chart. These are the pooled standard deviation, the pooled variance or mean square error (MSE), the standard error of each treatment mean (SEM) and of the difference between two treatment means (SED), and the least difference between two means which is significant at (e.g.) the 5% level of significance (LSD(5%)). The last three measures can be displayed as vertical bars in graphs, and the relationship between the lengths of these bars is graphically illustrated. It is suggested that the LSD is the most useful of these three measures. Second, when the experimenter has no prior hypotheses to be tested using analysis of variance ?contrasts,? a multiple comparison procedure (MCP) that examines all pair-wise differences between treatment means, may be appropriate. In this paper a fictitious experimental data set is used to compare several well- known MCPs by focussing on a particular operating characteristic, the consistency of the results between an overall analysis of all treatments and an analysis of a subset of the experimental treatments. The procedurethat behaves best according to this criterion is the unrestricted least significant difference (LSD) procedure. The unrestricted LSD is therefore recommended with the proviso that it be used as a method of generating hypotheses to be tested in subsequent experimentation, not as a method that attempts to simultaneously formulate and test hypotheses.},

Interactions among weathering, pedogenesis and geomorphic processes are emphasised, in an attempt to link the results obtained at different scales of observation. The important role of topography in controlling soil development or removal by erosive processes is discussed, in relation to the natural geomorphological context and the effects of human pressure. Both present-day and relict features were recognised in the studied soils, and discussed in terms of environmental conditions and climatic changes. The chemical composition of volcanoclastic components identified in some soil horizons with Andosol-like field appearance, coupled with pedogenetic features, contributed useful chronological constraints for the reconstruction of Late Quaternary geomorphic events.},

  Abstract                 = {Modi?cations associated with urban infrastructure directly impact soil properties. In particular, soil bulk density, microbial biomass and activity, and organic matter are impacted by anthropogenic activities. We proposed that urban soil properties are not only distinguishable from other systems, but also variable within types of landscapes in urban environments. We found soils from older urban landscapes (mean landscape age of 64 years) to be distinct from newer urban landscapes (mean landscape age of 9 years). Soil bulk densities were signi?cantly greater in newer (1.73 g cm 3 ) compared to older urban soils (1.41 g cm 3 ). Older urban soils had signi?cantly greater extractable phosphorous, weak Bray P (24%), strong Bray P (51%), and K (45%) than newer urban soils. Soil biological measures of nitrogen availability were signi?cantly greater in old compared to new urban soils, microbial biomass N (71%), potential C mineralization (20%), and potential N mineralization (83%). We found exponentially decreasing metabolic quotient values, qCO 2 , suggesting the impact of site disturbance decreases rapidly with time, and older urban landscapes are closer to steady-state conditions relative to younger urban landscapes. Total soil organic matter was signi?cantly greater (35%) in old urban soils. Fine POM was a larger contributor to total SOM in old compared to new urban soils. Particulate organic matter C/N ratios from older urban soils were less (coarse POM 14% less and ?ne POM 13% less) than newer urban soils. Of the soil forming factors, time played the most signi?cant role in soil physical, chemical, and biological differences. We believe that as time since initial disturbance increases, the impacts of urbanization are reduced by processes improving physical, biological, and chemical soil properties.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple answer is found for the following question which has plagued the practice of the analysis of variance: Under the usual assumptions, if the conventional F-test of the hypothesis H: ?1 = ?2 = ... = ?k at the ? level of significance rejects H, what further inferences are valid about the contrasts among the ?i (beyond the inference that the values of the contrasts are not all zero)? Suppose the F-test has k - 1 and ? degrees of freedom. For any c1, ..., ck with ?k 1 ci = 0 write ? for the contrast ?k 1 ci?i, and write $\hat\theta$ and $\hat\sigma^2_\hat\theta$ for the usual estimates of ? and the variance of $\hat\theta$ . Then for the totality of contrasts, no matter what the true values of the ?'s, the probability is 1 - ? that they all satisfy $\hat\theta - S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta \leqslant \theta \leqslant \hat\theta + S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta,$ where S2 is (k - 1) times the upper ? point of the F-distribution with k - 1 and ? degrees of freedom. Suppose we say that the estimated contrast $\hat\theta$ is `significantly different from zero' if $|\hat\theta| > S\hat\sigma_\hat\theta$ . Then the F-test rejects H if and only if some $\hat\theta$ are significantly different from zero, and if it does, we can say just which $\hat\theta$ . More generally, the above inequality can be employed for all the contrasts with the obvious frequency interpretation about the proportion of experiments in which all statements are correct. Relations are considered to an earlier method of Tukey using the Studentized range tables and valid in the special case where the $\hat\mu_i$ all have the same variance and all pairs $\hat\mu_i, \hat\mu_j (i \neq j)$ have the same covariance. Some results are obtained for the operating characteristic of the new method. The paper is organized so that the reader who wishes to learn the method and avoid the proofs may skip §§ 2 and 5.},

  Abstract                 = {Previous re-sampling of 31 New Zealand pasture soil profiles to 1 m depth found large and significant losses of C and N over 2-3 decades. These profiles were predominantly on intensively grazed flat land. We have extended re-sampling to 83 profiles, to investigate whether changes in soil C and N stocks were related to land use. Over an average of 27 years, soils (0-30 cm) in flat dairy pastures lost 0.73 ± 0.16 Mg C ha-1 y-1 and 57 ± 16 kg N ha-1 y-1 but we observed no significant change in soil C or N in flat pasture grazed by #dry##stock# (e.g., sheep, beef), or in grazed tussock grasslands. Grazed hill country soils (0-30 cm) gained 0.52 ± 0.18 Mg C ha-1 y-1 and 66 ± 18 kg N ha-1 y-1. The losses of C and N were strongly correlated, and C:N declined significantly. Further, results reported to 60 and 90 cm show that the pattern of losses and gains extend beyond the IPCC accounting depth of 30 cm. Specific causes for the soil C and N changes are unknown, but appear to be related to land use. In general, the losses under dairying correspond to systems with greater stocking rates, fertiliser inputs and removal of C and N in exported products. Gains in hill country pastures may be due to long-term recovery from erosion and disturbance following land clearance. The unexpected and contrary changes of C and N in different pasture systems (initially thought to be at steady state) demonstrates the need for global and national-scale collection of robust data investigating soil biogeochemical changes, not only for grasslands but also for other land uses. Re-sampling of soils can constrain the directions and magnitude of soil C and N change associated with land use and management to underpin C and N inventories and correctly identify mitigation options.},

Subjecting such samples to hydrofluoric acid removes mineral matter and leads to a relative increase in organic material. The effect of treatment with 10% hydrofluoric acid on bulk chemical composition and resolution of solid-state 13C NMR spectra was investigated with six soils, some associated particle size fractions, plant litter and compost. The treatment enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio of the solid-state I3C NMR spectra. The improvement in spectrum quality was greatest in the clay fraction of soil contaminated with coal ash. The removal of paramagnetic compounds associated with the ash may be the main reason for the improvement. Based on total C, total N, C/N ratio and intensity distribution of the solid-state I3C NMR spectra, no changes in organic matter composition could be detected, except for a possible loss of carbohydrates. After treatment with HF, solid-state I5N NMR spectra of particle size fractions were obtained and indicated that the observable nitrogen is present mostly as peptides and free amino groups. Extraction with hydrofluoric acid is recommended as a routine treatment prior to solid-state I3C and "N NMR on soil containing little C or N and soil samples containing paramagnetic compounds from natural or anthropogenic sources.},

However, in practice, one often has to cope with spatial interpolation achieved from few data that show a skewed distribution and uncertain information about soil contamination. We present a case study with 76 soil samples taken from a site of 15 square km in order to assess the usability of information gleaned from sparse data. The soil was contaminated with cadmium predominantly as a result of airborne emissions from a metal smelter. The spatial interpolation applies lognormal anisotropic kriging and conditional simulation for log-transformed data. The uncertainty of cadmium concentration acquired through data sampling, sample preparation, analytical measurement, and interpolation is factor 2 within 68.3 % confidence. Uncertainty predominantly results from the spatial interpolation necessitated by low sampling density and spatial heterogeneity. The interpolation data are shown in maps presenting likelihoods of exceeding threshold values as a result of a lognormal probability distribution. Although the results are not deterministic, this procedure yields a quantified and transparent estimation of the contamination, which can be used to delineate areas for soil improvement, remediation, or restricted area use, based on the decision-makers? probability safety requirement.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional scale inventories of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks often use soil and land use maps as key determinants in the upscaling procedure. Although soil and land use are important determinants for SOC stocks, there are other determinants that could potentially improve regional estimates of SOC stocks. So far, land use history is never used as a determinant for SOC stocks in regional inventories as a result of the limited quantitative knowledge of the effect of land use history on SOC stocks. In this paper we assess how land use, land use history and several site factors are associated with SOC variability in four sites across a physiographic region in the Netherlands. Determinants for SOC variability were identified with empirical analysis. Causality of the identified associations was tested with a process model. Results from both methods were compared and analyzed. Empirical analysis showed that historical land use has a stronger association with SOC variability than present-day land use, mainly because long-term agricultural areas have higher SOC contents than recent reclamations. Process modelling results show that land use systems with high carbon input have a 1.5 times larger SOC stock than low-input land use systems after 200 years. Significant differences between high-input and low-input systems only emerge after several decades and are maintained over 100 years. Due to the long-lasting imprint of historical land use systems combined with the high spatial variability of historical land use, current variability of SOC stocks is related to variation in land use history. The results can be used to calculate region-wide SOC stock estimates in upscaling procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Forest soil organic carbon (SOC) and forest floor carbon (FFC) stocks are highly variable. The sampling effort required to assess SOC and FFC stocks is therefore large, resulting in limited sampling and poor estimates of the size, spatial distribution, and changes in SOC and FFC stocks in many countries. Forest SOC and FFC stocks are influenced by tree species. Therefore, quantification of the effect of tree species on carbon stocks combined with spatial information on tree species distribution could improve insight into the spatial distribution of forest carbon stocks. We present a study on the effect of tree species on FFC and SOC stock for a forest in the Netherlands and evaluate how this information could be used for inventory improvement. We assessed FFC and SOC stocks in stands of beech (Fagus sylvatica), Douglas fir (Pseudotsugamenziesii), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), oak (Quercus robur) and larch (Larix kaempferi). FFC and SOC stocks differed between a number of species. FFC stocks varied between 11.1 Mg C ha1 (beech) and 29.6 Mg C ha1 (larch). SOC stocks varied between 53.3 Mg C ha1 (beech) and 97.1 Mg C ha1 (larch). At managed locations, carbon stocks were lower than at unmanaged locations. The Dutch carbon inventory currently overestimates FFC stocks. Differences in carbon stocks between conifer and broadleaf forests were significant enough to consider them relevant for the Dutch system for carbon inventory.},

  Abstract                 = {Classification tree analysis is evaluated as a predictive soil mapping technique for developing a preliminary soil map for neighboring site from samples extracted from an existing soil map. The objective of the research is to help guide future soil mapping in a nearby area. In order to determine the best overall modeling approach several variations were explored: the dependent variable (soil map class) was grouped at several hierarchical levels (according to Soil Taxonomy), sensitivity analysis was performed on the predictor variables (environmental variables acting as surrogates for soil forming factors), and the study area was divided into meaningful sub-areas (mountains and basins). Soil great group was discovered the most parsimonious dependent variable based on model results (misclassification error rate of 30.0% based on a test data set). Geomorphology (as measured by several landform variables) best explains the distribution of soil types. The terrain analysis variables did not explain a large amount of variance within the models. Dividing the study area in two separate modeling units increased overall model accuracy. Our results suggest that soil taxonomic class can be predicted with reasonable accuracy from environmental variables. In addition, the technique can provide limited insight into the variables that are most responsible for driving soil development in a given area. This technique could be used in soil survey to extrapolate obvious soil landscape relationships from one site to another, allowing soil experts to concentrate their field mapping effort in unique areas.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the problem of selecting a model having the best predictive ability among a class of linear models. The popular leave-one-out cross-validation method, which is asymptotically equivalent to many other model selection methods such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the Cp, and the bootstrap, is asymptotically inconsistent in the sense that the probability of selecting the model with the best predictive ability does not converge to 1 as the total number of observations n ? ?. We show that the inconsistency of the leave-one-out cross-validation can be rectified by using a leave-n?-out cross-validation with n?, the number of observations reserved for validation, satisfying n?/n ? 1 as n ? ?. This is a somewhat shocking discovery, because n?/n ? 1 is totally opposite to the popular leave-one-out recipe in cross-validation. Motivations, justifications, and discussions of some practical aspects of the use of the leave-n?-out cross-validation method are provided, and results from a simulation study are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping is critical when quantifying the relationship between soil types and their associated bio-physical environments. Digital mapping of regional soils affected by salt is essential when monitoring the dynamics of soil salts and planning land development and reclamatation schemes. In this paper, an easy method for digitally mapping salt-affected soils is proposed. This method allows the construction of the quantitative lower categories of soil classification based on Chinese Soil Taxonomy by using a geostatistical method and GIS technology. The data and maps used in this study were collected during a soil survey of salt-affected desert agro-ecological zones in Karamay, Xinjiang Autonomous Region, China. The survey covers an area of 525 km2 and includes 205 soil profiles. In addition, a classification and indicator system for the salt-affected soil in the region was established and 30 saltaffected soil types were identified. Three key soil classification indicators, viz. soil texture, texture stratification combination and total soil salinity, were selected to enable low-category soil classification. Furthermore, the information regarding climate, vegetation and topographic and geomorphologic features of the region was integrated into the analysis. A GIS-based regional digital soil classification map was then generated for three layers (0?30 cm, 30?60 cm, and 60?100 cm) after the observed soil salt distribution map and soil texture stratification maps were overlaid. This map would be used to draw up the strategies of the salt-affected soils improvement in desert. While compared with the conventional approaches, this new digital soil mapping method has the advantages of being prompt, quantitative, more objective, simpler and easier to update.},

  Abstract                 = {In addition to classical methods, namely kriging, Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and splines, which have been frequently used for interpolating the spatial patterns of soil properties, a relatively more accurate surface modelling technique is being developed in recent years, namely high accuracy surface modelling (HASM). It has been used in the numerical tests, DEM construction and the interpolation of climate and ecosystem changes. In this paper, HASM was applied to interpolate soil pH for assessing its feasibility of soil property interpolation in a red soil region of Jiangxi Province, China. Soil pH was measured on 150 samples of topsoil (0?20 cm) for the interpolation and comparing the performance of HASM, kriging, IDW and splines. The mean errors (MEs) of interpolations indicate little bias of interpolation for soil pH by the four techniques. HASM has less mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) than kriging, IDWand splines. HASM is still the most accurate one when we use the mean rank and the standard deviation of the ranks to avoid the outlier effects in assessing the prediction performance of the four methods. Therefore, HASM can be considered as an alternative and accurate method for interpolating soil properties. Further researches of HASM are needed to combine HASM with ancillary variables to improve the interpolation performance and develop a user-friendly algorithm that can be implemented in a GIS package.},

We distinguish global knowledge that covers the entire mapping area and local knowledge that is only applicable to certain local regions. We also distinguish knowledge represented by environmental values in parametrical space and knowledge represented by locations in geographical space. Rule-based reasoning (RBR) is proposed for handling the global knowledge in parametrical space, global case-based reasoning (CBR) for the global knowledge in geographical space, and local CBR for the local knowledge in geographical space. T e fi nal soil mapping products should represent an integration of knowledge and inferences of all diff erent types. A so?t ware tool, named Soil Inference Engine (SIE), was developed to facilitate an eight-step integrated RBR-CBR DSM process.

This paper presents an experiment using a circular neighbor- hood to calculate slope gradient. Comparisons of the results from a circular neighborhood with the results from some traditional methods show that (a) for a smooth surface, the result from a circular neighborhood is more accurate than that from a square neighborhood, (b) a circular neighborhood is generally more sensitive to noise in the input DEM than a square neighborhood, and (c) in a validation using field measurements, the circular neighborhood performs better than the square neighborhood when the ratio of user-specified neighborhood size to cell size is high.},

  Abstract                 = {Some problems in traditional soil mapping-high cost, high subjectivity, poor documentation, and low accuracy and precision-have motivated the development of a knowledge-based fuzzy soil mapping system, named SoLIM (Soil Land Inference Model). The rule-based method of the current SoLIM has its limitations. It requires explicit knowledge of the details of soil-environment relationships and it assumes that the environmental variables are independent from each other. This paper presents a case-based reasoning (CBR) approach as an alternative to the rule-based method. Case-based reasoning uses knowledge in the form of specific cases to solve a new problem, and the solution is based on the similarities between the new problem and the available cases. With the CBR method, soil scientists express their knowledge by providing locations (cases) indicating the association between a soil and a landscape or environmental configuration. In this way, the soil scientists avoid the difficulties associated with depicting the details of a soil-environment relationship and assuming the independence of environmental variables. The CBR inference engine computes the similarity between the environmental configuration at a given location and that associated with each case representing a soil type, and then uses these similarity values to approximate the similarity of the local soil at the given location to the given soil type. A case study in southwestern Wisconsin demonstrates that CBR can be an easy and effective way for soil scientists to express their knowledge. For the study area, the result from the CBR inference engine is more accurate than that from the traditional soil mapping process. Case-based reasoning can be a good solution for a knowledge-based fuzzy soil mapping system.},

  Abstract                 = {Land use change is one of the anthropogenic interventions that may induce substantial modi-? cations to both the quantity and quality of soil organic matter (SOM). Soils from three cultivated areas (two types of rainfed upland and one irrigated lowland) and two forests (subtropical managed and temperate unmanaged) in a midhill watershed of Nepal were stud- ied to assess the effect of land use change on SOM quality. Bulk SOM was analyzed using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fractionated by acid hydrolysis into pools with different chemical composition and, thus, different tendencies to decomposition. The NMR analysis showed a clear prevalence of O-alkyl C over alkyl C and aromatic C, with major differences between both soils and two depth intervals of the same soil (0?20 and 20?40 cm). Acid hydrolysis revealed that the labile C pool is larger in the 0- to 20- than the 20- to 40-cm soil depth of each land use. Labile C was larger in the temperate unmanaged forest and the irrigated cultivated land than in the other soils at both soil depths. Of the cultivated rainfed soils, the recently reclaimed soil contained less labile C than the historically cultivated soil, while the labile C in the irrigated soil exceeded that in both rainfed soils. The results suggest that changes in land use from forest to cultivation and the irrigation of the cultivated land may signi? cantly affect not only the quantity but also the quality of the SOM and, more importantly, its chemical recalcitrance to degradation. As a consequence, any future decisions regarding land management in the fragile mountain areas of Nepal should be carefully considered with respect to the nature of the SOM.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil erosion and depositional processes in relation to land use and soil management need to be quantified to better understand the soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. This study was undertaken on a Miamian soil (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs) under on-farm conditions in western Ohio with the objectives of evaluating the effects of degree of erosion on SOC stock under a range of tillage systems. Six farms selected for this study were under: no-till (NT) for 15, 10, 6 and 1.5 years; chisel till every alternate year with annual manure application (MCT); and annual chisel till (ACT). A nearby forest (F) site on the same soil was chosen as control. Using the depth of A horizon as an indicator of the degree of erosion, four erosion phases identified were: uneroded (flat fields under F, NT15, and on the summit of sloping fields under NT10, NT6, NT1.5 and MCT); deposition (NT10, NT6, NT1.5 and ACT); slight (NT10, MCT and ACT); and moderate erosion (NT10 and ACT). Core and bulk soil samples were collected in triplicate from four depths (i.e., 0?10, 10?20, 20?30 and 30?50 cm) for each erosional phase in each field for the determination of bulk density, and SOC concentrations and stocks. SOC concentration in NT fields increased at a rate of 5% year1 for 0? 10 cm and 2.5% year1 for 10?20 cm layer with increasing duration under NT. High SOC concentration for NT15 is indicative of SOC-sequestration potential upon conversion from plow till to NT. SOC concentration declined by 19.0?14.5 g kg1 in MCT and 11.3?9.7 g kg1 in NT10 between uneroded and slight erosion, and 12.0?11.2 g kg1 between slight and moderate erosion in ACT. Overall SOC stock was greatest in the forest for each of the four depths. Total SOC stock for the 50 cm soil layer varied in the order F (71.99 Mg ha1) > NT15 (56.10 Mg ha1) > NT10 (37.89 Mg ha1) = NT6 (36.58 Mg ha1) for uneroded phase (P < 0.05). The lack of uneroded phase in ACT indicated high erosion risks of tillage, as also indicated by the high SOC stock for deposition phase from 0 to 50 cm soil layer (ACT (56.56 Mg ha1) > NT1.5 (42.70 Mg ha1) > NT10 (30.97 Mg ha1)). Tillage increased soil erosion and decreased SOC stock for top 10 cm layer for all erosional phases except deposition.},

Six top soils were extracted for Mn, Cu, Fe, and Zn in a boiling water bath with NaOCl alone (5.3 %), NaOCl plus 0.005M DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid), or NaOCl with DTPA added during the last few minutes of extraction. Other variables were time (15 or 30 min) and one or two extractions. The effects of each method on the Mn oxide and amorphous Fe oxide fractions were evaluated. A second extraction increased the amounts of metal ions extracted. Increasing extraction time solubilized additional Mn and Zn but the effect was less for Cu and Fe. NaOCl + DTPA extraction values for the metals were not different from those for NaOCl alone. Adding DTPA during the last few minutes of extraction greatly increased the amounts of extractable metals. When DTPA was added at the end, metal values for the Mn oxide and amorphous Fe oxide fractions were significantly less than for the other two treatments. Two 30-min extractions with NaOCl alone are recommended. Since it appeared to extract microelements from the oxide fractions under these conditions, DTPA should not be added.},

  Abstract                 = {We examine the effects of capillarity and gravity in a model of one-dimensional imbibition of an incompressible liquid into a deformable porous material. We focus primarily on a capillary rise problem but also discuss a capillary/gravitational drainage con?guration in which capillary and gravity forces act in the same direction. Models in both cases can be formulated as nonlinear free-boundary problems. In the capillary rise problem, we identify time-dependent solutions numerically and compare them in the long time limit to analytically obtain equilibrium or steady state solutions. A basic feature of the capillary rise model is that, after an early time regime governed by zero gravity dynamics, the liquid rises to a ?nite, equilibrium height and the porous material deforms into an equilibrium con?guration. We explore the details of these solutions and their dependence on system parameters such as the capillary pressure and the solid to liquid density ratio. We quantify both net, or global, deformation of the material and local deformation that may occur even in the case of zero net deformation. In the model for the draining problem, we identify numerical solutions that quantify the effects of gravity, capillarity, and solid to liquid density ratio on the time required for a ?nite volume of ?uid to drain into the deformable porous material. In the Appendix, experiments on capillary rise of water into a deformable sponge are described and the measured capillary rise height and sponge deformation are compared with the theoretical predictions. For early times, the experimental data and theoretical predictions for these interface dynamics are in general agreement. On the other hand, the long time equilibrium predicted theoretically is not observed in our experimental data.},

  Abstract                 = {Local names have been used for centuries to name land, plots or sites and soils in the Netherlands [Vlam (1948)]. Most of these names can still be found on old topographic maps. The naming of land on the farm was similar to the custom of naming cattle, as the farmer knew his plots in great detail. Unfortunately, neither oral nor written traditions exist today concerning the use of specific names to identify soils and/or their properties. Only in rare cases could examples be found. The custom to name land decreased after the introduction of the land registry which introduced a numerical classification rather than names [Vlam (1951)]. In addition, extensive re-allocation works creating ever-bigger parcels of land caused the disappearance of many names. The introduction of the soil names at the Subgroup level of the Dutch Soil Classification System is seen as a valuable combination between the scientific name and the name of the locality or field, where a particular soil is well represented [Boor en Spade XV (1966) 25]. Examples are given of the development and names of two farming systems in different geographic regions in the Netherlands. The soil/land management practices were often governed by the biophysical position of the farms. On the higher sandy areas soil fertility was a major constraint for sustainable farming, whereas on the lower, clayey regions soil workability and water management were important issues. The farmers applied their local knowledge of the soil/land systems consistently and in a holistic manner. Their approach illustrates the influence of ethnopedology as described by Barrera-Bassols and Zinck [Geoderma (2002) this issue] on the development of modern agriculture in the Netherlands.},

  Abstract                 = {Neste trabalho teve-se como objetivo testar o modelo CENTURY para simular os efeitos das mudanças de uso da terra nos teores de carbono no solo e na produção primária líquida na bacia do rio Piracicaba, SP. O modelo foi parametrizado e as simulações foram realizadas considerando-se áreas de florestas, pastagens e cana-de-açúcar, dada a sua importância econômica. Os resultados obtidos indicaram que a alteração do uso/cobertura do solo provoca a diminuição do estoque de carbono do solo. As simulações realizadas na transição de uma floresta para cana-de-açúcar indicaram um decréscimo de 28% no estoque de carbono nos primeiros 12 anos, e diminuição de 42% com 50 anos de cultivo do solo com essa gramínea. Na simulação da transição de uma floresta para pasto, seguida do cultivo da cana-de- açúcar, verificou-se que na primeira mudança (floresta-pastagem) a perda de carbono foi de 24%, enquanto na segunda alteração (pastagem-cana) a perda foi de 22%. Com relação à produção primária, os resultados obtidos de floresta (6,6 t ha -1 ano -1 ), cana-de-açúcar (77, 82, 80 t ha -1 ano -1 ) e pasto (6,5 t ha -1 ano -1 ), mostraram-se similares aos valores observados no campo por outros autores.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil quality has become an important issue in soil science. Considerable attempts have been made to define soil quality, but a general concept has not yet been accepted by the scientific community. The selection of quantitative indices for soil quality is extremely difficult, and a considerable number of chemical, physical, and biochemical properties have been suggested as potential indicators of soil quality. Because soil organic matter (SOM) can be associated with different soil chemical, physical and biological processes, it has been widely considered as one of the best soil quality indicator. Land use can significantly influence dynamics of organic carbon and N, P, and S cycle. However, changes in total soil organic carbon (SOC) contents in response to land use may be difficult to detect because of the natural soil variability. In the short to medium term, biological properties and readily decomposable fractions of SOC, such as dissolved organic carbon (DOC), are much more sensitive to soil management than is SOM as a whole, and can be used as a key indicator of soil natural functions. Despite the fact that labile C accounts for a small portion of the total organic matter in the soils, DOC is the most mobile and important C-source for microorganisms, and can easily reflect the effects of land use on soil quality. Although several methods are used to characterize DOC, the factors influencing mineralization and bioavailability of elements associated with organic matter (N, P, and S) remains unclear. Future research should focus on the processes that govern DOC and nutrient dynamics and how they affect soil quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil texture plays a key role in belowground C storage in forest ecosystems and strongly influences nutrient availability and retention, particularly in highly weathered soils. We used field data and the Century ecosystem model to explore the role of soil texture in belowground C storage, nutrient pool sizes, and N fluxes in highly weathered soils in an Amazonian forest ecosystem. Our field results showed that sandy soils stored approximately 113 Mg C ha -1 to a 1-m depth versus 101 Mg C ha -1 in clay soils. Coarse root C represented a large and significant ecosystem C pool, amounting to 62% and 48% of the surface soil C pool on sands and clays, respectively, and 34% and 22% of the soil C pool on sands and clays to 1-m depth. The quantity of labile soil P, the soil C:N ratio, and live and dead fine root biomass in the 0?10-cm soil depth de- creased along a gradient from sands to clays, whereas the opposite trend was observed for total P, mineral N, potential N mineralization, and denitrification enzyme activity. The Century model was able to predict the observed trends in surface soil C and N in loams and sands but underestimated C and N pools in the sands by approximately 45%. The model predicted that total belowground C (0?20 cm depth) in sands would be approximately half that of the clays, in contrast to the 89% we measured. This discrepancy is likely to be due to an underestima- tion of the role of belowground C allocation with low litter quality in sands, as well as an overestima- tion of the role of physical C protection by clays in this ecosystem. Changes in P and water availability had little effect on model outputs, whereas adding N greatly increased soil organic matter pools and productivity, illustrating the need for further integra- tion of model structure and tropical forest biogeo- chemical cycling.},

Wet oxidation methods using hydrogen peroxide are widely used for that purpose, but are said to modify poorly crystalline soil constituents. We investigated the effect of a modified NaOCl oxidation (pH 8) on the mineral composition of 12 subsoils (4.9?38.2 g organic C kg1) containing varying amounts of poorly crystalline mineral phases, i.e. 1.1?20.5 g oxalate-extractable Fe kg1, and of different phyllosilicate mineralogy. Post-oxidative changes in mineral composition were estimated by (i) the determination of elements released into the NaOCl solution, (ii) the difference in dithionite- and oxalate-extractable Si, Al and Fe, and (iii) the specific surface areas (SSAs) of the soils. The NaOCl procedure reduced the organic C concentrations by 12?72%. The amounts of elements released into the NaOCl extracts were small (0.14 g kg1 for Si, 0.13 g kg1 for Al, and 0.03 g kg1 for Fe). The SSA data and the amounts of dithionite- and oxalate-extractable elements suggest that the NaOCl oxidation at pH 8 does not attack pedogenic oxides and hydroxides and only slightly dissolves Al from the poorly crystalline minerals. Therefore, we recommend NaOCl oxidation at pH 8 for the purpose of isolating a stable organic matter pool in soils for process studies of organic matter stabilization.},

The 2% HF treatment resulted in the removal of the highest Fe concentrations (79-95%) while the dithionite/citrate extractions were less effective in removing Fe from the same soils (18-75%). The Fe remaining after HF treatment appeared to be mostly associated with ilmenite crystals which were only slowly attacked by the dilute acid. During the 2% HF treatments, some organic carbon was lost (8-17%), but this loss had no significant effect on the organic chemistry of the samples as determined by CP/MAS 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy. The total 13C signal recovered after the various treatments was found to be correlated, in order of decreasing significance, with the mineral fraction present in the sample, the organic carbon/Fe ratio and the mass magnetic susceptibility. The expression (organic carbon/Fe) -0.147 (mineral fraction present in the sample) +0.043 (1/mass magnetic susceptibility), accounted for 85.3% of the variation in the relative visibility of the 13C signal. Prior to soil state CP/MAS 13C n.m.r. analysis, the recommended pretreatment for surface soils containing Fe involves a sequence of 2% HF extractions in the order 5 x 1 h, 2 x 16 h and 1 x 64 h. For soils high in Fe, this procedure allows CP/MAS 13C n.m.r. spectra to be acquired that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. It also results in a significant increase in sensitivity and in resolution of the 13C n.m.r. spectra of soils with moderate Fe contents.},

Since the authors do not correctly characterize the models mentioned, it is felt useful to correct the record in that regard, and to put the proposed model of Wainwright et al. in better perspective. The current models named in the criticism by Wainwright et al. include KINEROS (Woolhiser et al., 1990), KINEROS2 (Smith et al., 1995), EUROSEM (Morgan et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1995), and WEPP (Ascough et al., 1997). We refer to these below as the ?critiqued models.? The writers? familiarity with those models and their assumptions provide justifi cation for the clarifi cations presented below. We note here that some of the models critiqued have had developments added, and published, since their initial release.},

An expository review of these methods is presented. It is concluded that data splitting is an effective method of model validation when it is not practical to collect new data to test the model. The DUPLEX algorithm, developed by R. W. Kennard, is recommended for dividing the data into the estimation set and prediction set when there is no obvious variable such as time to use as a basis to split the data. Several examples are included to illustrate the various methods of model validation.},

  Abstract                 = {The electromagnetic radiation (EMR) signals collected by satellites in the solar spectrum are modified by scattering and absorption by gases and aerosols while traveling through the atmosphere from the Earth's surface to the sensor. When and how to correct the atmospheric effects depend on the remote sensing and atmospheric data available, the information desired, and the analytical methods used to extract the information. In many applications involving classification and change detection, atmospheric correction is unnecessary as long as the training data and the data to be classified are in the same relative scale. In other circumstances, corrections are mandatory to put multitemporal data on the same radiometric scale in order to monitor terrestrial surfaces over time. A multitemporal dataset consisting of seven Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images from 1988 to 1996 of the Pearl River Delta, Guangdong Province, China was used to compare seven absolute and one relative atmospheric correction algorithms with uncorrected raw data. Based on classification and change detection results, all corrections improved the data analysis. The best overall results are achieved using a new method which adds the effect of Rayleigh scattering to conventional dark object subtraction. Though this method may not lead to accurate surface reflectance, it best minimizes the difference in reflectances within a land cover class through time as measured with the Jeffries–Matusita distance. Contrary to expectations, the more complicated algorithms do not necessarily lead to improved performance of classification and change detection. Simple dark object subtraction, with or without the Rayleigh atmosphere correction, or relative atmospheric correction are recommended for classification and change detection applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Due to its modest data demands and transparent model structure, the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) remains the most popular tool for water erosion hazard assessment. However, the model has several shortcomings, two of which are likely to have prominent implications for the model results. First, the mathematical form of the USLE, the multiplication of six factors, easily leads to large errors whenever one of the input data is misspecified. Second, the USLE has a modest correlation between observed soil losses and model calculations, even with the same data that was used for its calibration. This raises questions about its mathematical model structure and the robustness of the assumed parameter values that are implicitly assigned to the model. This paper, therefore, analyzes if the USLE could benefit from mathematical model transformations that, on one hand, mitigate the impact of incorrect input factors and, on the other hand, result in a better fit between model results and observed soil losses. For the analysis, we revisit the original data set and consider the USLE factors as variables rather than their common interpretation as parameters. We first use both nonparametric and parametric techniques to test the robustness of the implicit parameter assignments in the USLE equation. Next, we postulate alternative mathematical forms and use parametric test statistics to evaluate parameter significance and model fit. A tenfold cross-validation of the model with the best fit tests the sensitivity of the parameters for inclusion or exclusion of the data. The results show that the USLE model is not very robust, however, only slight model improvements are obtained by drastic modifications of its functional form, thereby sacrificing the simple model structure that was intended by its designers.},

  Abstract                 = {Paralelamente à aceitação dos reservatórios de carbono florestais para mitigar o impacto do dióxido de carbono emitido à atmosfera, gera-se uma demanda de técnicas que permitam mensurar e monitorar o carbono das florestas nos projetos de desenvolvimento limpo. Os erros que provém da amostragem, são muito maiores que os associados ao processo de análise de amostras, assim, é importante desenvolver planos de amostragem adequados que permitam alcançar a precisão desejada e sem viés na informação. Desta maneira, o objetivo do estudo foi conhecer o comportamento do estoque de carbono nos solos, na fazenda Três Lagoas, localizada no Município de Angatuba, São Paulo, Brasil, área com diferente cobertura e uso de solo: Eucalipto, Pastagem e Floresta Nativa, e conhecer como o sistema de amostragem influencia as estimativas assim como o esforço amostral necessário para a determinação do estoque de carbono. Coletaram-se 406 unidades amostrais distribuídas nas profundidades 0-10 cm e 10-20 cm e por meio da estatística clássica determinou-se que o estoque de carbono é de 39,6 MgC.ha-1. O menor esforço amostral necessário foi determinado na amostragem sistemática estratificada, com uma distância de amostragem na grade de 979 m. A geoestatística foi uma ferramenta que permitiu conhecer o alcance prático da variável (650 m). Pelo valor da diferença do critério de Akaike, os modelos: exponencial, Matérn com kappa 1, kappa 2 e esférico foram iguais. Difere entre eles o alcance prático que cada modelo determinou. O modelo esférico apresentou o maior alcance prático e o menor esforço amostral comparado aos outros modelos. Conclui-se que existem diferenças nos sistemas de amostragem empregados, os quais dependem das variáveis de estudo, da profundidade e do uso do solo. Tanto a estatística clássica quanto a geoestatística mostraram ser ferramentas úteis na predição do estoque de carbono em solos.},

Isso pode ser explicado pelo fato de que o método tradicional de levantamento de solos é lento e caro, requerendo grande número de observações de campo. Assim, o presente trabalho teve como objetivo caracterizar unidades de mapeamento de solos das regiões de Ibaté e São Carlos, SP, desenvolvidos de materiais basálticos e areníticos em função da declividade e altitudes correspondentes, com base em modelo digital de elevação (MDE). Primeiramente, foi feito um mapa de solos semidetalhado pelo método tradicional. Posteriormente, utilizando-se curvas de nível da região, foi elaborado o MDE, do qual foram extraídos mapas com diferentes classes de declividade e elevação. Por meio da tabulação cruzada, foi determinada a incidência de cada solo nas respectivas classes de declives e altitudes. Cada solo apresentou comportamento diferenciado em relação às classes de declive. Contudo, nas faixas limítrofes de declividade pode ocorrer sobreposição de dois ou mais solos. Na referida região, o Latossolo Amarelo encontra-se predominantemente nas regiões mais altas e de relevo plano; entretanto, solos pouco intemperizados, como os Neossolos Litólicos, aparecem em diferentes faixas de declividade. Conclui-se que o conhecimento da distribuição dos solos no relevo é de grande importância, pois facilita a execução do levantamento de solos. O modelo de elevação apresenta semelhanças com o mapa de solos, podendo auxiliar na sua determinação. As variações de solo, no entanto, são mais complexas, não dispensando as observações de campo.},

Dessa forma, práticas de manejo, como a adubação, devem levar em consideração esta variabilidade. O sensoriamento remoto é uma ferramenta que pode fornecer, de maneira rápida, informações para o manejo do solo, pois relaciona a radiação eletromagnética com os atributos do solo. Assim, este trabalho teve como objetivo avaliar o comportamento espectral, em dois níveis de aquisição de dados (terrestre e orbital), de diferentes classes de solos ao longo de toposseqüências na região de São Carlos e Ibaté, SP. Para isso, amostras de terra georreferenciadas foram coletadas em 319 pontos, em três profundidades. Em seguida, obtiveram-se os dados radiométricos em laboratório, na faixa espectral entre 450 e 2.500 nm. Os mesmos locais amostrados na camada superficial, no campo, foram avaliados na imagem de satélite. A partir dos resultados obtidos, pode-se concluir que: (a) teores de areia grossa, argila e matéria orgânica, e cor tiveram relação com a reflectância dos solos; (b) ao longo das vertentes ocorrem variações nos dados espectrais dos solos; e (c) solos da mesma ordem taxonômica, porém com classes texturais diferentes, apresentam diferentes comportamentos espectrais, podendo ser discriminados por sensoriamento remoto.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic C is often suggested as an indicator of soil quality, but desirable targets are rarely specified. We tested three approaches to define maximum and lowest desirable soil C contents for four New Zealand soil orders. Approach 1 used the New Zealand National Soils Database (NSD). The maximum C content was defined as the median value of long-term pastures, and the lower quartile defined the lowest desirable soil C content. Approach 2 used the CENTURY model to predict maximum C contents of long-term pasture. Lowest desirable content was defined by the level that still allowed recovery to 80% of the maximum C content over 25 yr. Approach 3 used an expert panel to define desirable C contents based on production and environmental criteria. Median C contents (0?20 cm) for the Recent, Granular, Melanic, and Allophanic orders were 72, 88, 98, 132 Mg ha?1, and similar to contents predicted by the CENTURY model (78, 93, 102, and 134 Mg ha?1, respectively). Lower quartile values (54, 78, 73, and 103 Mg ha?1, respectively) were similar to the lowest desirable C contents calculated by CENTURY (55, 54, 67, and 104 Mg ha?1, respectively). Expert opinion was that C contents could be depleted below these values with tolerable effects on production but less so for the environment. The CENTURY model is our preferred approach for setting soil organic C targets, but the model needs calibrating for other soils and land uses. The statistical and expert opinion approaches are less defensible in setting lower limits for desirable C contents.},

Os estudos foram realizados na Bacia Experimental de Sumé, que foi instalada numa das sub-bacias da Bacia Representativa de Sumé. O trabalho de implantação, iniciado em 1981 pela então Superintendência do Desenvolvimento do Nordeste (SUDENE) com o apoio do ORSTOM (França) e do CNPq, contava com nove parcelas de erosão de 100 m2 com diferentes coberturas e declividades e quatro microbacias de aproximadamente 0,5 ha de área, além de várias parcelas de 1 m 2 sob chuva simulada. Duas das microbacias estavam desmatadas, enquanto as outras estavam cobertas pela vegetação nativa (Caatinga). Com os dados coletados, foram realizados análises e estudos comparativos do escoamento superficial e erosão do solo entre as diversas unidades de experimento. Os resultados reforçam a necessidade de técnicas de modelagem para a previsão do escoamento e erosão proveniente. Foram utilizados diversos modelos para avaliar o escoamento e os resultados em geral foram bastante satisfatórios. No caso da erosão do solo, foi utilizado um modelo distribuído hidrodinâmico. Apresenta-se uma discussão sobre os diversos aspectos deste processo de modelagem e acredita-se que esta experiência pode ser muito útil na avaliação da erosão hídrica na região semi-árida do Nordeste brasileiro.},

  Abstract                 = {Neossolos Regolíticos (Regosols/Entisols), even is being successfully used from an economical perspective with horticulture and reforestation, are fragile from a natural resource perspective because their small depth, presence of stones and/or rocks, near surface lithic contact, fractures in saprolite and frequent occurrence in steep slopes. Neossolos have been classified as materials of low potential use, which in partcaused inadequate morphological field description by soil survey teams. Population growth and urban expansion requires over areas with Neossolos require larger volume of data and a more specific analysis for abetter interpretation of these soils capacity to filtrate water, retain and transform solute and water contributing to the maintenance of the water quality that reaches the underground reservoirs. In that sense thisstudy was an attempt to generate information on Neossolos from the edge of the Plateau of Rio Grande do Sul State. Five Neossolos profiles were studied regarding their chemical (pH, soil organic carbon, bases and aluminum saturation, cations exchange capacity); physical (aggregation, bulk density of soil and saprolite, pore space, size distribution of soil particles, water storage capacity of thesaprolite,fractures in the saprolite) and morphologic (profile thickness, soil color, consistence) analyses were performed. A correlation analysis of these attributes with the water infiltration in soil resulted thatthere were great variations in the hidraulic behavior among the Neossolos sampled in different location as well as among the replications in the same location. The main components analysis indicated thatthe soil water infiltration has strong relationship with the total porosity, angles of fractures in the saprolite and with the distribution of the particle size fractions of the soil.},

  Abstract                 = {Every day, thousands of satellite and aerial photographs are taken for the use in domains such as GIS analysis and city planning. These images are subject to distortion due to camera tilt and ground relief. In order to use the imagery, this distortion must be corrected by creating a top-down view of the source image. This process is called orthorectification and enables the end-user to accurately measure real distances, angles and areas. In our paper we present an open source implementation for automated orthorectification using a set of cross-referenced Ground Control Points (GCPs), called AutoGCP. Commercial software packages providing automated orthorectification are either extremely expensive or inaccurate in detecting GCPs. Manual GCP selection on the other hand is labour intensive and may result in warped images, due to misplaced GCPs. The openness of the source code allows for continuous improvements and by using academically proven algorithms and calculations, AutoGCP provides a trusted implementation that can be verified. In our paper we firstly explain the theoretical process of detecting and extracting GCPs from a previously orthorectified reference image, cross-referencing these points with the distorted raw image and finally correcting the raw image, creating an ortho-image. Secondly, the practical implementation of the above-mentioned processes is discussed. The AutoGCP C++ library extends the existing open source Quantum GIS (QGIS) library and a Python plug-in for QGIS provides an aesthetical frontend interface for the automated orthorectification processes.},

We attempted replication of that finding. Students (41 male, mean age=24.7 yr., SD=7.7) rated 16 images on a scale of open/enclosed. There was a strong effect on impressions of enclosure for angle above observer (r = .91), and this effect was larger than the effect of height (r = -.17), but there also was another strong effect for distance (r = -.68). Moreover, the effect of distance was dependent on angle above observer (r = -.52). Thus, partial replication was achieved, and a new relationship between the geometry of environments and perceived enclosure was identified.},

Choosing a sampling design for assessing thematic map accuracy requires the strength of a sampling design to be matched to the objectives and resources available for the accuracy assessment. The criteria to consider when planning the sampling design are that the sample should: (1) satisfy probability sampling protocol; (2) be simple to implement and analyse; (3) result in low variance for the key estimates of the assessment; (4) permit adequate variance estimation; (5) be spatially well distributed; and (6) be cost effective. Several basic probability sampling designs useful for accuracy assessment are reviewed, and recommendations are provided to guide the selection of an appropriate design. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

We discuss options available for each of these components. A statistically rigorous assessment requires both a probability sampling design and statistically consistent estimators of accuracy parameters, along with a response design determined in accordance with features of the mapping and classification process such as the land-cover classification scheme, minimum mapping unit, and spatial scale of the mapping.},

  Abstract                 = {Consider a continuous Gaussian random field z(x) defined on a compact set $R \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with covariance function of the form $\operatorname{cov}(z(x), z(x')) = \sum^k_{i = 1}\theta_iK_i(x,x')$ , where the Ki's are specified and θ = (θ1, ..., θk)' is to be estimated. Let {xl}∞ l = 1 be a sequence of distinct points in R. Based on z(x1), ..., z(xN), minimum norm quadratic estimation can be used to estimate θ. Suppose K1, ..., Kk are compatible covariance functions on R, which means that the Gaussian measures with means zero and covariance functions K1, ..., Kk are mutually absolutely continuous. Then, as the number of observations N increases, the minimum norm quadratic estimator of ∑k i = 1θi is asymptotically normal with variance of order N-1. The minimum norm quadratic estimator of any other linear combination of the θi's converges (in L2) to some nondegenerate random variable. This limit is the same for any two dense sequence of points in R. Thus, a definition of a minimum norm quadratic estimator of θ when z(·) is observed everywhere in R is obtained.},

Suppose (m0, K0) is the second-order structure used to produce the predictions when in fact (m1, K1) is the correct second-order structure and (m0, K0) and (m1, K1) are "compatible" on R. For bounded R, as the points of observation become increasingly dense in R, predictions based on (m0, K0) are shown to be uniformly asymptotically optimal relative to the predictions based on the correct (m1, K1). Explicit bounds on this rate of convergence are obtained in some special cases in which K0 = K1. A necessary and sufficient condition for the consistency of best linear unbiased predictors is obtained, and the asymptotic optimality of these predictors is demonstrated under a compatibility condition on the mean structure.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose z(·) is a random process defined on a bounded set $R \subset \mathbb{R}^1$ with finite second moments. Consider the behavior of linear predictions based on z(t1), ..., z(tn), where t1, t2, ⋯ is a dense sequence of points in R. Stein showed that if the second-order structure used to generate the predictions is incorrect but compatible with the correct second-order structure, the obtained predictions are uniformly asymptotically optimal as n → ∞. In the present paper, a general method is described for obtaining rates of convergence when the covariance function is misspecified but compatible with the correct covariance function. When z(·) is Gaussian, these bounds are related to the entropy distance (the symmetrized Kullback divergence) between the measures for the random field under the actual and presumed covariance functions. Explicit bounds are given when R = [ 0, 1] and z(·) is stationary with spectral density of the form f(λ) = (a2 + λ2)-p, where p is a known positive integer and a is the parameter that is misspecified. More precise results are given in the case p = 1. An application of this result implies that equally spaced observations are asymptotically optimal in the sense used by Sacks and Ylvisaker in terms of maximizing the Kullback divergence between the actual and presumed models when z(·) is Gaussian.},

Designs using this idea when G = [ 0, 1 ] have been studied for some time. For G a region in two dimensions, very little is known about the statistical properties of cubature rules based on designs with varying density. This work proposes a class of designs that are locally parallelogram lattices but whose densities can vary. The asymptotic variance of the cubature error for these designs is obtained for a class of isotropic random fields and an asymptotically optimal sequence of cubature rules within this class is found. I conjecture that this sequence of cubature rules is asymptotically optimal with respect to all cubature rules.},

  Abstract                 = {This work investigates some spectral characteristics of the errors of optimal linear predictors for weakly stationary random fields. More specifically, for errors of optimal linear predictors, results here explicitly bound the fraction of the variance attributable to some set of frequencies. Such a bound is first obtained for random fields on Rd observed on the infinite lattice δJ for all J on the d-dimensional integer lattice. If the spectral density exists, then the faster the spectral density tends to 0 at high frequencies, the more quickly this bound tends to 0 as $\delta \downarrow 0$ . Under certain conditions on the spectral density, a similar result is given for processes on R where both observations and predictands are confined to a finite interval and observations may not be evenly spaced. These results provide a powerful tool for studying a problem the author has previously addressed using different methods: the properties of linear predictors calculated under an incorrect spectral density. Specifically, this work gives a number of new rates of convergence to optimality for predictors based on an incorrect spectral density when the ratio of the incorrect to the correct spectral density tends to 1 at high frequencies.},

  Abstract                 = {When predicting the value of a stationary random field at a location x in some region in which one has a large number of observations, it may be difficult to compute the optimal predictor. One simple way to reduce the computational burden is to base the predictor only on those observations nearest to x. As long as the number of observations used in the predictor is sufficiently large, one might generally expect the best predictor based on these observations to be nearly optimal relative to the best predictor using all observations. Indeed, this phenomenon has been empirically observed in numerous circumstances and is known as the screening effect in the geostatistical literature. For linear predictors, when observations are on a regular grid, this work proves that there generally is a screening effect as the grid becomes increasingly dense. This result requires that, at high frequencies, the spectral density of the random field not decay faster than algebraically and not vary too quickly. Examples demonstrate that there may be no screening effect if these conditions on the spectral density are violated.},

  Abstract                 = {The spatial distribution of a natural resource is an important consideration in designing an efficient survey or monitoring program for the resource. We review a unified strategy for designing probability samples of discrete, finite resource populations, such as lakes within some geographical region; linear populations, such as a stream network in a drainage basin, and continuous, two-dimensional populations, such as forests. The strategy can be viewed as a generalization of spatial stratification. In this article, we develop a local neighborhood variance estimator based on that perspective, and examine its behavior via simulation. The simulations indicate that the local neighborhood estimator is unbiased and stable. The Horvitz–Thompson variance estimator based on assuming independent random sampling (IRS) may be two times the magnitude of the local neighborhood estimate. An example using data from a generalized random-tessellation stratified design on the Oahe Reservoir resulted in local variance estimates being 22 to 58 percent smaller than Horvitz–Thompson IRS variance estimates. Variables with stronger spatial patterns had greater reductions in variance, as expected. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital soil mapping approaches that require quantitative data for prediction are difficult to implement in countries with limited data on soil and auxiliary variables. However, in many such cases there is a wealth of qualitative information available, such as profile descriptions, catenas or general purpose soil surveys. This type of information opens possibilities for more qualitative approaches to digital soil mapping when quantitative mapping is unfeasible. In this study we used a classification tree approach combined with literature and a small dataset of 40 point SOC observations to map the topsoil organic carbon (SOC) content for a data-poor environment in the Senegalese Peanut Basin. A literature review provided an overview of the driving factors of soil variability in the Peanut Basin. Geomorphology, topography, vegetation, and land use were identified as the main factors explaining the spatial variation of SOC in the Peanut Basin. These factors were represented in a classification tree by variables that were derived from a digital elevation model and a satellite image. Threshold values and actual predictions for the classification tree were based on literature and the small soil dataset. Next the classification tree was used to create a map of SOC for the study area. Using cluster random sampling, 155 locations were sampled for validation. Validation of the model results showed a poor model performance with large prediction errors. Error analysis showed that although the variables that were used to predict SOC were important sources of variability, a larger soil dataset is needed to better calibrate the classification tree model. Calibration of the classification tree on the basis of the validation dataset produced much improvement and acceptable results after cross-validation. It is concluded that digital soil mapping on the basis of existing knowledge and general auxiliary information is feasible, provided that a sufficiently large and appropriately collected soil dataset is available for calibration.},

Increasing CO 2 concentration increases crop yield once the substrate for photosynthesis and the gradient of CO 2 concentration between atmosphere and leaf increase. C3 plants will benefit more than C4 plants at elevated CO 2 . However, if global warming will take place, an increase in temperature may offset the benefits of increasing CO 2 on crop yield.},

  Abstract                 = {Em estudos do impacto de mudanças climáticas sobre agroecossistemas, um aspecto importante a quantificar é o efeito do aquecimento global sobre o desenvolvimento vegetal. O objetivo desse trabalho foi simular o impacto de cenários climáticos de aumento de temperatura do ar no desenvolvimento da batata (Solanum tuberosum L.), em Santa Maria, (RS). Cenários meteorológicos de mudanças climáticas (+2 °C, +3 °C, +4 °C, +5 °C e +6 °C) para os próximos cem anos foram gerados com Weather Generator LARS-WG usando-se como base a série de dados meteorológicos observados de 1969 a 2003, em Santa Maria, RS. Por meio de um modelo matemático, calculou-se a taxa diária de desenvolvimento da planta e a data dos principais estágios de desenvolvimento da batata, cv. Asterix: emergência, início de tuberização, início de senescência e colheita. Foram consideradas duas épocas de cultivo da batata, o cultivo de outono (plantio em 10/2) e o cultivo de primavera (plantio em 20/7). Verificou-se, para o cultivo de outono, um grande aumento (até 42 dias) no ciclo total (emergência-colheita) com o aumento da temperatura do ar. Já para o cultivo de primavera, obteve-se uma tendência de um pequeno encurtamento (5-8 dias) do ciclo total da batata com o aumento da temperatura média do ar, dependendo do nível de aquecimento. Fases intermediárias do desenvolvimento da batata poderão ter alterações que dependem da época de cultivo. Essas diferentes tendências no comportamento do desenvolvimento da batata refletem a complexidade da resposta dos agroecossistemas à mudança climática.},

A handicap for the control of the insidious erosion process is the difficulty of determining its magnitude. Four causes are often mentioned in the literature: the large temporal and spatial variation of erosion, the paucity of accurate erosion measurements, the problem of extrapolating data from small plots to higher scales and the conversion of erosion into production and monetary units (impact). It is an illusion to think that the role of measurements can be taken over by the application of erosion prediction technology. Measurements are needed to develop, calibrate and validate that technology. Measurement techniques differ in accuracy, equipment and personnel cost. The most accurate (and often most expensive) techniques do not always serve the measurement purpose. This paper gives a critical overview of current measurements techniques for erosion at different spatial and temporal scales. Examples are presented of techniques for direct measurements as well as for indirect measurements, i.e. measurements of soil properties that serve as input for models. The paper is concluded with a critical evaluation.},

Among the possible constraints the most useful are (a) to set the constant term of the equation to zero, or (b) to omit one of the dummy variables from the equation. In working with a single system of classes either constraint can be used, and results from the application of one are readily derived from those obtained from the other. If several systems of classes are involved the best procedure is to delete one dummy variable from each system.},

  Abstract                 = {Sustainable land management and land use planning require reliable information about the spatial distribution of the physical and chemical soil properties affecting both landscape processes and services. Although many studies have been conducted to identify the spatial patterns of soil property distribution on various scales and in various landscapes, only little is known about the relationships underlying the spatial distribution of soil properties in intensively used, finely structured paddy soil landscapes in the southeastern part of China. In order to provide adequate soil information for the modelling of landscape processes, such as soil water movement, nutrient leaching, soil erosion and plant growth, this study investigates to what extent cheap and readily available ancillary information derived from digital elevation models and remote sensing data can be used to support soil mapping and to indicate soil characteristics on the landscape scale. This article focuses on the spatial prediction of the total carbon and nitrogen content and of physical soil properties such as topsoil silt, sand and clay content, topsoil depth and plough pan thickness. Correlation analyses indicate that, on the one side, the distribution of C, N and silt contents is quite closely related to the NDVI of vegetated surfaces and that, on the other side, it corresponds significantly to terrain attributes such as relative elevation, elevation above nearest drainage channel and topographical wetness index. Geostatistical analyses furthermore reflect a moderately structured spatial correlation of these soil variables. The combined use of the above mentioned terrain variables and the NDVI in a multiple linear regression accounted for 29% (silt) to 41% (total C) of the variance of these soil properties. In order to select the best prediction method to accurately map soil property distribution, we compared the performance of different regionalization techniques, such as multi-linear regression, simple kriging, inverse distance to a power, ordinary kriging and regression kriging. Except for the prediction of topsoil clay content, in all cases regression kriging model ??C?? performed best. Compared to simple kriging, the spatial prediction was improved by up to 14% (total C), 13% (total N) and 10% (silt). Since the autocorrelation lengths of these spatially well correlated soil variables range between three and five times the soil sampling density, we consider regression kriging model ??C?? to be a suitable method for reducing the soil sampling density. It should help to save time and costs when doing soil mapping on the landscape scale, even in intensively used paddy soil landscapes.},

  Abstract                 = {Apparent electrical conductivity of soil (ECa) is a property frequently used as a diagnostic tool in precision agriculture, and is measured using vehicle-mounted proximal sensors. Crop-yield data, which is measured by harvester-mounted sensors, is usually collected at a higher spatial density compared to ECa. ECa and crop-yield maps frequently exhibit similar spatial patterns because ECa is primarily controlled by the soil clay content and the interrelated soil moisture content, which are often significant contributors to crop-yield potential. By quantifying the spatial relationship between soil ECa and crop yield, it is possible to estimate the value of ECa at the spatial resolution of the crop-yield data. This is achieved through the use of a local regression kriging approach which uses the higher-resolution crop-yield data as a covariate to predict ECa at a higher spatial resolution than would be prudent with the original ECa data alone. The accuracy of the local regression kriging (LRK) method is evaluated against local kriging (LK) and local regression (LR) to predict ECa. The results indicate that the performance of LRK is dependent on the performance of the inherent local regression. Over a range of ECa transect survey densities, LRK provides greater accuracy than LK and LR, except at very low density. Maps of the regression coefficients demonstrated that the relationship between ECa and crop yield varies from year to year, and across a field. The application of LRK to commercial scale ECa survey data, using crop yield as a covariate, should improve the accuracy of the resultant maps. This has implications for employing the maps in crop-management decisions and building more robust calibrations between field-gathered soil ECa and primary soil properties such as clay content.},

This project quantifies carbon stocks and fluxes in the humid forest zone of Ghana, as a part of an assessment in West Africa. The General Ensemble biogeochemical Modeling System(GEMS) was used to simulate the responses of natural and managed systems to projected scenarios of changes in climate, land use and cover, and nitrogen fertilization in the Assin district of Ghana. Model inputs included historical land use and cover data, historical climate records and projected climate changes, and national management inventories. Our results show that deforestation for crop production led to a loss of soil organic carbon (SOC) by 33% from 1900 to 2000. The results also show that the trend of carbon emissions from cropland in the 20th century will continue through the 21st century and will be increased under the projected warming and drying scenarios. Nitrogen (N) fertilization in agricultural systems could offset SOC loss by 6% with 30 kg N ha1 year1 and by 11% with 60 kg N ha1 year1. To increase N fertilizer input would be one of the vital adaptive measures to ensure food security and maintain agricultural sustainability through the 21st century.},

Diante do exposto, objetivou-se avaliar a eficiência da dispersão mecânica (agitação lenta com agitador orbital de mesa ? 30 rpm por 16 h, na presença de abrasivo, e agitação rápida com agitadores do tipo coqueteleira ? 1.200 rpm por 20 min) e química com NaOH 1N, associada ao pré-tratamento para eliminação da matéria orgânica, independentemente de seu teor na amostra de solo na realização da análise granulométrica utilizada como método de rotina. Para as análises, foram coletadas com trado holandês, em uma área de Latossolo Vermelho eutroférrico, 50 amostras de forma inteiramente casualizada, nas profundidades de 0?0,20 e de 1,15?1,25 m; cada amostra representou uma repetição. Foi possível concluir que: sempre ocorreu maior dispersão das amostras analisadas quando se fez o prétratamento para oxidação da MO; o processo de agitação lenta, em relação ao de agitação rápida, é sempre mais eficiente na dispersão das amostras de solo; e o tratamento que utilizou pré-tratamento para eliminação da MO e dispersão mecânica com agitação lenta por 16 h e 30 g de areia grossa como abrasivo foi mais eficiente na dispersão das amostras estudadas, tanto para as amostras coletadas entre 0 e 0,20 m como para as coletadas na profundidade de 1,15?1,25 m.},

  Abstract                 = {In Australia, soil salinity is one of the most devastating forms of land degradation facing agricultural production. In northern New South Wales (NSW), where irrigated-cotton production is a dominant agricultural commodity, salinity even though is not currently such a serious problem, could pose a potential threat to cotton production. This chapter explores the use of discriminant analysis (DA) and other alternative models for using ancillary data to create threshold-based risk maps (rather than continuous maps) of soil salinity and compares these maps with more traditional indicator predictions. The opportunity for incorporating an error analysis into DA is also explored. The hypothesis for including the error analysis in DA and related models is that a certain level of information remains in the residuals of the initial model and that this information could be extracted and analysed to improve the final prediction. The ancillary-based models used in this chapter did not produce better predictions than a Multi-Indicator Kriging (MIK) approach that did not include the ancillary data. The DA models produced better prediction than the Multi-Variate Stepwise Linear Regression with the Kriging (MSLR-K) and Binomial Linear Regression models. A benefit of the DA approaches is the generation of probability maps, similar to MIK, that may be used in future decision making.},

O nível de infestação de moscas foi avaliado por meio do monitoramento em placas (Scudder Fly Grill). Nas áreas das leiras, reduções de 98,5% e 100% foram atingidas em 18 e 30 dias, respectivamente, após a aplicação do produto. Na estação de transferência do lixo, observaram-se reduções de 85,6% e 98,7% no mesmo período de tempo.

Computational models that perform probabilistic inference over hierarchies of flexibly structured representations can address some of the deepest questions about the nature and origins of human thought: How does abstract knowledge guide learning and reasoning from sparse data? What forms does our knowledge take, across different domains and tasks? And how is that abstract knowledge itself acquired?},

Com o objetivo de estabelecer essas relações, efetuou-se um mapeamento detalhado dos depósitos geológicos superficiais, das superfícies geomórficas e das unidades de solos de uma área na microbacia do ribeirão Marins em Piracicaba, SP. Tais relações foram obtidas através de um sistema geográfico de informações e de um índice de homogeneidade para avaliar quantitativamente as inter-relações de cada tema estudado. A estratigrafia da área está representada por siltitos e folhelhos da formação Corumbataí, arenitos da formação Pirambóia, uma cobertura neo-cenozóica de textura média e por sedimentos holocênicos coluviais e aluviais. Foram identificadas cinco superfícies geomórficas e foram estabelecidas dez unidades de mapeamento em cinco classes, LATOSSOLO, ALISSOLO, ARGISSOLO, CAMBISSOLO e NEOSSOLO. O LATOSSOLO VERMELHO-AMARELO está relacionado à cobertura neocenozóica e à superfície I, mais alta. O ALISSOLO e os ARGISSOLOS VERMELHO-AMARELOS de textura arenosa/média relacionam-se aos arenitos da formação Pirambóia e às superfícies II e III em áreas com declive suave, posicionadas abaixo da I. Os NEOSSOLOS LITÓLICOS argilosos estão associados aos siltitos da formação Corumbataí, ocorrendo nas superfícies IV e V, mais recentes, inferiores e em áreas muito inclinadas. Os CAMBISSOLOS HÁPLICOS de textura variada relacionam-se aos alúvios-colúvios da base. Quanto mais velha e estável for a superfície geomórfica mais homogênea ela é em relação aos solos ue nela ocorrem. A evolução pedogenética é maior na medida em que em que aumenta a idade da superfície. A variabilidade dos atributos químicos e físicos dos solos na camada de 60-80cm é influenciada principalmente pela natureza química e física do substrato geológico, enquanto que os atributos morfológicos são determinados principalmente pelo relevo. Estas relações se repetem na paisagem da microbacia com características de solo, relevo e litologia semelhantes, permitindo sua extrapolação para outras áreas, contribuindo para futuros levantamentos detalhados de solos que possam vir a ser realizados na região.},

  Abstract                 = {Measuring the specific surface area (SSA) of soils that contain much organic matter (OM) is problematic. The adsorption of p-nitrophenol (pNP) from xylene at room temperature yielded realistic values for the SSA of a wide range of clays, oxides and subsoils. Here we have extended the same measurement to some topsoils with varied OM content, texture and clay mineral composition. Specifically, we have compared the surface areas measured by adsorption of N2, and, applying the BET equation, with the values obtained by adsorption of pNP, before and after treatment of the samples with hydrogen peroxide. In all instances, the removal by H2O2 of organic matter ? albeit in part only ? led to a marked increase in the SSAs measured by nitrogen because of the exposure of micropores previously blocked or covered by OM. The surface areas measured by pNP were appreciably larger than those obtained by the standard BET equation, and showed little change after removal of organic matter. However, the surface area of two smectite-rich samples measured by pNP increased substantially after peroxidation, presumably because smectite crystals decomposed during treatment with H2O2. The results suggest that, under the experimental conditions used, pNP could diffuse without hindrance into and through organic matter, enabling it to adsorb on to micropore surfaces within clay aggregates (domains). In keeping with this suggestion, the relation between the surface areas measured by pNP and the corresponding values calculated from the clay and OM contents, and clay mineral composition, of the soils was close to 1:1. An even stronger relation was observed between the measured and calculated values for cation exchange capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {A software package AHP-DRASTIC has been developed to derive ratings and weights of modi?ed DRASTIC model parameters for use in speci?c aquifer vulnerability assessment studies. The software is integrated with ArcView Geographical Information System (GIS) software for modelling aquifer vulnerability, to predict areas which are more likely than others to become contaminated as a result of activities at or near the land surface. The ranges of a few of the DRASTIC model parameters have been modi?ed to adapt to local hydrogeologic settings. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been used to compute the ratings and weights of the criteria and sub-criteria of all parameters used in the DRASTIC model. The output from AHP generates a MS Access database for these parameters, which is then interfaced with ArcView using Avenue Scripts. AHP-DRASTIC is aimed at providing user- friendly GUI interfaced with GIS for the estimation of weights and ranks of the thematic layers used for aquifer vulnerability assessment. Contingency table analysis indicates that all wells in low and high vulnerability category have concentrations less than 10 ppm and more than 10 ppm, respectively. The model is validated with groundwater quality data and the results have shown strong relationship between DRASTIC Speci?c Vulnerability Index and nitrate-as-nitrogen concentrations with a correlation co- ef?cient of 0.84 at 0.01 level.},

  Abstract                 = {The present study involves the possibility of using geology and relief to map soil classes. We initially focused on two small catchments considered as representative of a 6000-ha forested area overlying a sandstone bed. The catchments differed in the stratigraphic sequence of sandstones, i.e., rich or poor in weatherable minerals. In one, the depleted bedrock was downstream and the rich was upstream, and the converse obtained for the second. Relationships between soil classes and environmental factors were modeled using two discriminant functions corresponding to the two types of stratigraphic sequences found in the catchments. More than 70% of the soil class distribution in small catchments can be explained by the nature of the substratum and attributes derived from a digital elevation model DEM . These relationships were then applied to a larger region. An automatic catchment delineation was first carried out with the DEM and was then combined with geologic maps. The choice between the two discriminant functions was based on the stratigraphic sequences in each catchment. Predicted soil classes were compared to soil classes conventionally mapped in 1978 at the scale of 1:100,000. The results show that the model reproduced the soil map over 55% of the area studied. Disagreements were due primarily to the existence of superficial deposits not mentioned on the geologic maps and to an altitude effect that is not sufficiently considered in the study of small catchments.},

With respect to confidence intervals, when interpreting a 95% interval, we should never say that we are 95% confident that our interval captures the estimated population parameter. It is explained that effect sizes should be reported even for statistically nonsignificant effects. And, most importantly of all, it is emphasized that effect sizes should not be interpreted using Cohen's benchmarks.

  Abstract                 = {The spatial distribution of hydromorphic soils across the landscape affects soil survey, broad-scale wetland identification, and ecological studies. The change from upland to wetland is frequently difficult to delineate because it often occurs along a gradual continuum. We have developed a color index, the Profile Darkness Index (PDI), to assist in making these delineations. The PDI is well correlated with the duration of saturated and reducing conditions in specific Mollisol catenas in humid regions of the north-central USA. The objective of this research was to use soil-landscape modeling techniques to relate the variation of PDI to terrain attributes that describe the flow and accumulation of water on hillslopes. Regression models that quantify the relationships between terrain attributes and PDI on a hillslope in west-central Minnesota indicate that variability in slope gradient, profile curvature, and elevation above local depression explained up to 65% of the variability in PDI. These models may be used to estimate the areal extent of hydromorphic soils using terrain attributes derived from a high-resolution (10-m resolution) digital elevation model and to quantify relationships between spatial variability of terrain attributes and of PDI. Knowledge of the terrain attributes that are statistically important according to these models, and their relative effects on PDI (e.g., as slope gradient decreases, PDI increases) may be applied to field-scale delineations of hydric soils.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil-landscape modeling techniques have been developed as a quantitative method to predict patterns of soil properties from observed patterns in soil-forming factors. However, transportability of these models to unsampled landscapes is unknown. Our objective was to develop quantitative soil-landscape models for multiple study sites and examine the similarity of these quantitative models, and therefore the similarity of soil-landscape relationships among areas with similar soils. We collected high resolution digital elevation models (DEM) for six study sites across the Pennyroyal physiographic region of Kentucky, and for each study site used terrain attributes derived from the DEM to collect discrete soil samples using a stratified random sampling design for morphological, physical, and chemical characterization. For three of these sites we examined the inherent differences in terrain attributes among sites, and developed quantitative soil-landscape models that predict the spatial patterns in A-horizon depth, surface soil organic carbon content, and surface sand and silt content. The other three sites were used to test the transportability of these models. Terrain attribute distributions differ significantly among study sites, with regional terrain attributes (upslope contributing area, topographic wetness index) being more similar among fields than local terrain attributes (slope gradient, slope curvature). Predictive models explained from 28% to 67% of the variation in soil properties. The terrain attributes that best predicted soil variability were similar across all three fields used for model development, with slope gradient, elevation, slope curvature, and upslope contributing area appearing in most of the models. However, applying models from one field to other fields within the same physiographic region produced inconsistent results. In general, prediction quality decreased with distance from the site of model development. Further sampling, modeling, and validation at additional field sites are required to properly establish model transportability.},

Moreover, forest soils may serve as important C sinks for ameliorating excess atmospheric CO2 Spatial estimates of soil organic C (SOC) storage have traditionally relied upon soil survey maps and laboratory characterization data. This approach does not account for inherent variability within map units, and often relies on incomplete, unrepresentative, or biased data. Our objective was to develop soil-landscape models that quantify relationships between SOC and topographic variables derived from digital elevation models. Within a 1500-ha watershed in eastern Kentucky, the amount of SOC stored in the soil to a depth of 0.3 m was estimated using triplicate cores at each node of a 380-m grid. We stratified the data into four aspect classes and used robust linear regression to generate empirical models. Despite low coefficients of correlation between measured SOC and individual terrain attributes, we developed and validated models that explain up to 71% of SOC variability using three to five terrain attributes. Mean SOC content in the upper 30 cm, as predicted from our models, is 5.3 kg m?2, compared with an estimate of 2.9 kg m?2 from soil survey data. Total SOC storage in the upper 30 cm within the entire watershed is 82.0 Gg, compared with an estimate of 44.8 Gg from soil survey data. A soil-landscape modeling approach may prove useful for future SOC spatial modeling because it incorporates the continuous variability of SOC across landscapes and may be transportable to similar landscapes.},

This concept views the soil resource as a dynamic 3-dimensional geomorphological landscape and presents information as regolith-terrain (R-T) data in the context of Regolith-Catenary Units (RCUs) in an explicit and repeatable process. RCUs are 3-dimensional R-T systems and are viewed as composite R-T entities. They are described through soil geomorphic techniques. Observations of the regolith are limited, so conceptual models of the R-T as RCUs are necessary. Spatial expression of RCUs is achieved through the predictive capabilities of digital terrain analysis using derivative functions from digital terrain models. Landform attributes are combined as RCU components through a set of fuzzy rules to form simulated RCUs. These are closer to the conceptual and linguistic definition of hillslope components and their geomorphic processes. The concept is applied to predicting soil and regolith attributes derived through fuzzy classification to produce continuous data surfaces for a forested terrain in southeast Queensland. These then serve as decision support [`]maps' of the R-T attributes that relate directly to site-specific management of the forest land resource},

  Abstract                 = {Tuning parameters in supervised learning problems are often estimated by cross-validation. The minimum value of the cross-validation error can be biased downward as an estimate of the test error at that same value of the tuning parameter. We propose a simple method for the estimation of this bias that uses information from the cross-validation process. As a result, it requires essentially no additional computation. We apply our bias estimate to a number of popular classifiers in various settings, and examine its performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring C content is essential for carrying out surveys and inventories on C storage in soils under different land uses (LUs). The objectives of the present study, which was conducted in five agro-ecoregions in Brazil with contrasting climates, LU managements, soil texture gradients, and soil depths, were to: (i) develop a C-equivalent correction factor (CF) between total organic carbon determined by dry combustion (TOCDC) and organic carbon by wet oxidation recorded by the Walkley–Black (OCWB) method, and (ii) assess the influence of LU, soil texture gradients, and sampling depth on a C-equivalent CF based on a linear model adjusted for each experimental location. The results indicated an effect of LU at almost all sites, except for one subtropical location where clay content and sampling depth were the most important factors. Additionally, there were LU × clay and LU × sampling depth interactions on the C-equivalent CF. The linear models computed to estimate the CF from this set of qualitative (LU) and quantitative variables (soil texture gradient and soil depth) differed among and within the agro-ecoregions and LU managements. The C-equivalent CF in subtropical sites ranged from 1.37 to 1.55, while for tropical sites ranged from 1.13 to 1.60. These models are site specific, and the results demonstrate the need to develop models calibrated for each site before extrapolating to other agro-ecoregions to recalculate past soil C inventories and to evaluate temporal changes of SOC stocks.},

The collected runoff is stored in cubic tanks equipped with ten taps for sampling the suspension. When an erosive event occurs, the plot runoff volume is measured by means of the water level in the tank, and the corresponding mean measured concentration in the suspension is quantified. The calibration curve of the specific storage system and of the measurement procedure used makes it possible to derive the actual concentration. The event plot soil loss is quantified as the product of the actual concentration and the runoff volume. The calibration curve was determined for two soil types. In any case a linear relationship was found between an actual and measured concentration. Slopes of regression vary with water depths in the tank. The calibration model does not significantly vary with the soil type considered due to the low difference in the coarse sand percentage in the two soils (according to Stokes' law). The measurement devices and the sampling procedure being equal, the calibration curve determined can be used to correct the measured concentration in the actual concentration for any soils that are characterized by a coarse sand percentage similar to that of the soil used to derive it.},

The greatest soil C densities occur where deep raised bogs are the dominant soil; in these grid squares C density can reach 3000 t C haK1. Most of the loss of soil C between 1990 and 2000?up to 23 Mt C (1% of 1990 soil C stock)?was through industrial peat extraction. The average annual change in soil C stocks from 1990 to 2000 due to land use change was estimated at around 0.02% of the 1990 stock. Considering uncertainties in the data used to calculate soil C stocks and changes, the small average annual ?loss? could be regarded as ?no change?.},

Although in 1939 there was more mixed farming than at present, with a reduction of almost 60% in arable land, there has been little change in soil carbon stock (385.9 Mt in 1939, 385.43 Mt in 2000).

The guide includes a comparison to the windowed Fourier transform, the choice of an appropriate wavelet basis function, edge effects due to finite-length time series, and the relationship between wavelet scale and Fourier frequency. New statistical significance tests for wavelet power spectra are developed by deriving theoretical wavelet spectra for white and red noise processes and using these to establish significance levels and confidence intervals. It is shown that smoothing in time or scale can be used to increase the confidence of the wavelet spectrum. Empirical formulas are given for the effect of smoothing on significance levels and confidence intervals. Extensions to wavelet analysis such as filtering, the power Hovmöller, cross-wavelet spectra, and coherence are described. The statistical significance tests are used to give a quantitative measure of changes in ENSO variance on interdecadal timescales. Using new datasets that extend back to 1871, the Niño3 sea surface temperature and the Southern Oscillation index show significantly higher power during 1880–1920 and 1960–90, and lower power during 1920–60, as well as a possible 15-yr modulation of variance. The power Hovmöller of sea level pressure shows significant variations in 2–8-yr wavelet power in both longitude and time.},

We demonstrate this pattern of judgment and behavior in adherence to ethical standards (e.g., cheating), religious traditions (e.g., skipping religious rituals), and performance standards (e.g., “cutting corners” on a task). We also show that the motivation to adhere to standards by using proper means is independent and follows a different pattern from the motivation to reach the end state of goal pursuit.},

We distinguish between two dimensions of motivation: the motivation to attain a focal goal (outcome-focused dimension) and the motivation to “do things right” in the process of reaching that goal (means-focused dimension). We identify the conditions under which the motivation to reach a focal goal increases versus decreases over the course of goal pursuit. We then propose that the motivation to “do things right” follows a u-shaped pattern, such that it is higher at the beginning and end of goal pursuit than in the middle. },

  Abstract                 = { Since the early emergence of Earth observation satellites, researchers have investigated different methods of extracting three-dimensional information using satellite data. Apart from a few early stereo images by hand-held photographs acquired during the Gemini and Apollo missions, the first experiments to extract three-dimensional data using stereo viewing from space began with the Earth Terrain Camera flown onboard SkyLab in 1973/74. Since this time, various analogue or digital sensors in the visible spectrum have flown to provide researchers and geoscientists with spatial data to extract and interpret three-dimensional information of the Earth's surface. Although clinometry techniques can be applied with the optical sensor images, stereo viewing of images was and still is the most common method used by the mapping, photogrammetry and remote sensing communities for elevation modelling. The paper will review clinometry and stereoscopy and their applicability to the different satellite sensors (space photographs and scanners). Their performances to extract absolute or relative elevation from various research and commercial organizations are addressed. The respective advantages, difficulties and constraints of the sensors are discussed, as well as the methods and the technologies used for extracting elevation data in an operational context. },

Firstly, the stereo HRS and HRG photogrammetric bundle block adjustments using spatiotriangulation and autocalibration were set-up with 10 ground control points and errors of about half-resolution were obtained over 190 and 95 independent checkpoints (ICPs): 6.4&#xa0;m, 6.8&#xa0;m and 5.1&#xa0;m in X, Y and Z axes, and 2.6&#xa0;m, 2.2&#xa0;m and 2.9&#xa0;m in X, Y and Z axes for HRS and HRG, respectively. The internal accuracy are, however, better because these errors include the half-pixel image plotting error and the 3&#xa0;m cartographic error on ICPs. Only the results with HRS were achieved with autocalibration of the lens to correct for the radial distortions due to the largest number of pixels. The DTMs were then generated using an area-based multi-scale image matching method and 3D semi-automatic editing tools, and then compared to lidar data with 0.2&#xa0;m accuracy in elevation. An elevation error with 68% confidence level (LE68) of 5.2&#xa0;m and 6.5&#xa0;m were achieved over the full area for HRS and HRG, respectively. Since the DTM is in fact a digital surface model where the height, or a part, of different land cover classes (trees, houses) is included, the accuracy is depending on the land cover types. Using previous 3D visual classification, different classes (forests, residential areas, bare surfaces) were generated to take into account the height of the surfaces (natural and human-made) in the accuracy evaluation. LE68 values of 3.2&#xa0;m to 6.7&#xa0;m were thus obtained depending on the land cover types. On the other hand, LE68 values of 2.4&#xa0;m and 2.2&#xa0;m were obtained over bare surfaces for HRS and HRG, respectively. These last results are more representative of the real stereo SPOT-5 potential for DTM, compliant with the highest topographic standard.},

The protocol uses standard distance metrics, Standardized Euclidean and Mahalanobis distances, to determine the distance from the mean of the calibration data and the subject. Distances exceeding a designated cutoff limit are deemed distinct from the calibration data and as such unsuitable for function application. An example is provided whereby a function to predict Cation Exchange Capacity is trained on a local dataset and applied to a second dataset with large pedodiversity. Those subjects suitable for functions application are identified via the proposed protocol. The proposed protocol is dependent on the provision of robust estimates of mean, standard deviation and covariance matrix of the calibration data.},

  Abstract                 = {This study proposes a new concept for upscaling local information on failure surfaces derived from geophysical data, in order to develop the spatial information and quickly estimate the magnitude and intensity of a landslide. A new vision of seismic interpretation on landslides is also demonstrated by taking into account basic geomorphic information with a numeric method based on the Sloping Local Base Level (SLBL). The SLBL is a generalization of the base level de ? ned in geomorphology applied to landslides, and allows the calculation of the potential geometry of the landslide failure surface. This approach was applied to a large scale landslide formed mainly in gypsum and situated in a former glacial valley along the Rhône within the Western European Alps. Previous studies identi ? ed the existence of two sliding surfaces that may continue below the level of the valley. In this study, seismic refraction?re ? exion surveys were carried out to verify the existence of these failure surfaces. The analysis of the seismic data provides a four-layer model where three velocity layers (b1000 ms? 1 , 1500 ms? 1 and 3000 ms? 1 ) are interpreted as the mobilized mass at different weathering levels and compaction. The highest velocity layer (N4000 m s? 1 ) with a maximum depth of ~58 m is interpreted as the stable anhydrite bedrock. Two failure surfaces were interpreted from the seismic surveys: an upper failure and a much deeper one (respectively 25 and 50 m deep). The upper failure surface depth deduced from geophysics is slightly different from the results obtained using the SLBL, and the deeper failure surface depth calculated with the SLBL method is underestimated in comparison with the geophysical interpretations. Optimal results were therefore obtained by including the seismic data in the SLBL calculations according to the geomorphic limits of the landslide (maximal volume of mobilized mass =7.5×10 6 m 3 ).},

An electronic computer was used to solve and test equations for several positions in each plot. Areas that crossed soil boundaries were excluded. The equations of 75% of the remaining positions closely approximated the data and were used in this study. Parameters representing slope, rate of change of slope, and radius of curvature were obtained from the equations. These parameters were used to classify the shapes of the land surfaces both qualitatively and quantitatively. Three-dimensional plots of these parameters correctly predicted the drainage class of 90% of the positions with usable equations. Surfaces having equivalent drainage at all points were defined by equations in terms of radius, slope, and rate of change of slope.},

This fast-cycling organic matter is largely comprised of undecomposed plant material and hydrolyzable components associated with mineral surfaces. Turnover times of fast-cycling carbon vary with climate and vegetation, and range from <20 years at low latitudes to >60 years at high latitudes. The amount and turnover time of C in passive soil carbon pools (organic matter strongly stabilized on mineral surfaces with turnover times of millennia and longer) depend on factors like soil maturity and mineralogy, which, in turn, reflect long-term climate conditions. Transient sources or sinks in terrestrial carbon pools result from the time lag between photosynthetic uptake of CO2 by plants and the subsequent return of C to the atmosphere through plant, heterotrophic, and microbial respiration. Differential responses of primary production and respiration to climate change or ecosystem fertilization have the potential to cause significant interrannual to decadal imbalances in terrestrial C storage and release. Rates of carbon storage and release in recently disturbed ecosystems can be much larger than rates in more mature ecosystems. Changes in disturbance frequency and regime resulting from future climate change may be more important than equilibrium responses in determining the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.},

New features of this dataset include bimonthly composites, NOAA-9 descending node data from August 1994 to January 1995, volcanic stratospheric aerosol correction for 1982– 1984 and 1991–1993, NDVI normalization using empirical mode decomposition/ reconstruction to minimize varying solar zenith angle effects introduced by orbital drift, inclusion of data from NOAA-16 for 2000–2003 and NOAA-17 for 2003–2004, and a similar dynamic range with the MODIS NDVI. Two NDVI compositing intervals have been produced: a bimonthly global dataset and a 10- day Africa-only dataset. Post-processing review corrected the majority of dropped scan lines, navigation errors, data drop outs, edge-of-orbit composite discontinuities, and other artefacts in the composite NDVI data.

We have to face up to bouquets of alternative challenges ? of alternative probability structures that are relevant, yet extreme. And we have to focus on bouquets of alternative procedures, most, if not all, of which are not the results of formal optimisation. To select a procedure for use on a given sort of data set most carefully, we need to assess performance over combinations of procedures and challenges, often minimaxing over challenges. Such assessment will rarely be possible without simulation, perhaps of an analogous situation. Selection of bouquets of challenges will involve experience, direct and extrapolated, as will selection of bouquets of procedures. Thus it will not be wrong for different experts of the greatest experience to choose different analyses of the same data. Moreover, the bouquets conventionally considered for any class of problem will evolve over time, thus changing preferred procedures. These are customary characteristics of other branches of engineering ? data analysis, to be practical, has to be engineering, not science. Model development, for real world description, not for inference, is a procedure of successive approximations where assumptions can be vital. Sound inference, on the other hand, demands facing alternative possibilities, as illustrated by diverse challenges.},

A pesquisa foi desenvolvida em uma estrutura denominada ?Bacia Hidrográfica Experimental? do Departamento de Engenharia Rural da UNESP, Câmpus de Jaboticabal - SP. Nessa estrutura, foram utilizadas superfícies caracterizadas como H, 10N, 10S, 20N, 20S, 10E, 10W, 20E e 20W. O sensor utilizado para medir a radiação solar global incidente nas superfícies estudadas foi um piranômetro da marca Kipp & Zonnen, modelo CM3. Para calcular a radiação solar incidente nas superfícies estudadas, foi utilizado o modelo de Kondratyev. As análises dos resultados foram feitas para o período diário, utilizando-se de análise de regressão e considerando o modelo linear (y = ax + b), na qual a variável dependente foi a radiação global medida (K?M) e a radiação global calculada (K?C) foi a variável independente. Os resultados deste estudo mostram que o modelo apresentou bons resultados para estimar a radiação nas superfícies H, 10N, 10S, 10E, 10W, 20E e 20W. Utilizando-se de dados de dias com céu límpido, foram obtidos os seguintes resultados: no inverno, o modelo foi preciso para estimar a radiação solar na superfície 20N, e apresentou resultados aceitáveis para estimar a radiação solar na superfície 20S.},

  Abstract                 = {O conhecimento indígena sobre a pedodiversidade é o objeto principal da etnopedologia. Nesse sentido, a tradição agrícola e cultural dos índios Uapixana, do tronco lingüístico Aruaque, em Roraima, constitui relevante acervo imaterial de valor etnocientífico, sendo valorizada pela Universidade Federal de Roraima em seus cursos superiores de Educação Indígena no Estado. Neste trabalho confrontou-se a experiência etnopedológica dos índios Uapixana com o Sistema Brasileiro de Classificação de Solos, durante o levantamento de solos da Terra Indígena (TI) Malacacheta. O sistema de classificação etnopedológica existente na comunidade indígena Uapixana da TI Malacacheta identifica e separa todos os principais compartimentos ambientais de ocorrência na área, permitindo relacionar aspectos de simples percepção e identificação (cor, textura, profundidade, vegetação) com aspectos cognoscíveis (uso, tipo de cultivo, vocação, etc.). Os índios Uapixana identificam e classificam oito tipos básicos de solos, que ocorrem individualmente ou formando associações: Imii Wyzda?u (Terra Amarelada), Imii Wyza?u (Terra Vermelha), Imii Pudiidiu (Terra Preta), Imii Pudiidiza?u (Terra Roxa), Katy Bara Pudiidiu (Barro Arenoso), Imii Kaxidia?u (Estopa Preta), Imii Katy Bara Pudiidiu Naik Baraka?u (Terra Arenosa Preta e Branca) e Imii Wyzadaza?u Rik Pudiidiu (Miscelânea de Terra Amarela, Roxa e afloramentos de rocha), abordando características morfológicas, físicas e químicas e as principais limitações quanto ao uso agrícola. Há relação evidente entre a dimensão do saber etnopedológico o saber etnoecológico, em sentido amplo. A experiência etnopedológica representa, assim, a extensão de uma abrangente cadeia de inter-relações homem-meio, dentro do princípio universal da ecologia humana da paisagem. O diálogo etnopedológico travado entre a comunidade indígena e os pedólogos trouxe contribuições muito relevantes e mutuamente benéficas: facilitou a transferência de conhecimento entre dois saberes, in loco, desvendando boa parte das relações etnopedológicas e etnoecológicas e refletindo sobre ?como? e ?por que? cada grupo identificava um dado tipo de solo. Permitiu ainda delinear o esboço da distribuição dos solos com base no saber indígena, utilizando a extrapolação cartográfica disponível ao pedólogo; esse fato facilitou o próprio mapeamento convencional, especialmente no reconhecimento de inclusões e associações de solos. De forma mais destacada, a experiência permitiu ainda uma real comunicação e aproximação entre os agentes do saber (indígenas e técnico), com base na troca e em descobertas mútuas de conhecimentos, gerando uma sinergia que aproxima o técnico e o indígena, com resultados práticos palpáveis, que extrapolam o próprio objetivo inicial do levantamento de solos da TI Malacacheta.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapid changes in upland farming systems in Southeast Asia generated predominantly by increased population pressure and ?market forces? have resulted in widespread land degradation that has been well documented at the plot scale. Yet, the links between agricultural activities in the uplands and downstream off-site effects remain largely unknown because of the difficulties in transferring results from plots to a larger scale. Many authors have thus pointed out the need for long-term catchment studies. The objective of this paper is to summarize the results obtained by the Management of Soil Erosion Consortium (MSEC) over the last 5 years from 27 catchments in five countries (Indonesia, Laos, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam). The purpose of the study was to assess the impacts of cultivation practices on annual runoff and erosion rates. Initial surveys in each catchment included topography, soils and land use. Monitoring included climatic, hydrologic and erosion (total sediment yield including bed load and suspended sediment load) data, land use and crop yields, and farmers? income. In addition, new land management options were introduced through consultations with farmers and evaluated in terms of runoff and erosion. These included tree plantations, fruit trees, improved fallow with legumes, maize intercropped with legumes, planted fodder, native grass strips and agro-ecological practices (direct sowing and mulch-based conservation agriculture). Regressions analyses showed that runoff during the rainy season, and normalized runoff flow coefficient based on erosive rainfall during the rainy season (rainfall with intensity exceeding 25 mm h?1) increase with the percentage of the catchment covered by maize. Both variables decrease with increasing soil depth, standard deviation of catchment slope (that reflects terrain roughness), and the percentages of the catchment covered by fallow (regular and improved), tree plantations and planted fodder. The best predictors of sediment yield were the surface percentages of maize, Job's tears, cassava and footpaths. The main conclusions generated from this study were: (i) soil erosion is predominantly influenced by land use rather than environmental characteristics not only at the plot scale but also at the catchment scale; (ii) slash-and-burn shifting cultivation with sufficiently long rotations (1 year of cultivation, 8 years of fallow) is too often unjustly blamed for degradation; (iii) in its place, continuous cropping of maize and cassava promotes high rates of soil erosion at the catchment scale; (iv) conservation technologies are efficient in reducing runoff and total sediment yield at the catchment scale; (v) the adoption of improved soil management technologies by upland farmers is not a function of the degree of intensification of their farming system and/or of their incomes. The results suggest that if expansion of maize and cassava into already degraded upland systems were to occur due to increased demand for biofuels, there is a risk of higher runoff and sediment generation. A failure to adopt appropriate land use management strategies will result in further rapid resource degradation with negative impacts to downstream communities.},

This selection aimed at data potential for geomorphometric derivations, given by the preservation of detailed geometric characteristics of the resulting digital elevation models (DEM), which are sensitive to refining procedures. The development contained a long-term experimentation stage, when data refinement through kriging was locally developed to support distinct regional projects, followed by a unified selection stage, where the acquired experience was applied to select a single and unified interpolation scheme. In this stage, the selected geostatistical models with promising performances were tested for unified refinement on 40 Brazilian areas with distinct geological settings. Tested areas encompass reliefs varying from mountainous to plain. The effects of data preparation were observed on the perception of patterns (texture and roughness), as well as of singularities (edges, peaks, thalwegs etc.). Results were evaluated mainly through the examination of shaded reliefs, transects and perspectives observed in different scales. Terrains with low slopes and small amplitudes had their DEM promptly affected by the refining methods, as opposed to mountainous terrains. The evaluation, unambiguously confirmed by all consulted interpreters, converged into a refining model with outstanding performance in all tested conditions.},

Nos Organossolos ocorrem diferentes riscos de subsidência, resultantes de seus atributos, em especial da natureza da matéria orgânica e do ambiente de deposição. Este estudo foi realizado com dados de 19 perfis de solos de diferentes regiões do Brasil. Foram adotados os procedimentos da SBCS para descrição e coleta dos perfis, e os métodos analíticos da Embrapa Solos para caracterização dos solos. A análise dos componentes principais foi utilizada para agrupar os perfis com o auxílio de atributos morfológicos, físicos, químicos e do ambiente de ocorrência e mostrou-se adequada no agrupamento dos solos estudados com base em seus atributos, comparando-se com a sua taxonomia. Neste artigo foram usados os métodos multicritério ordinais de Borda, Condorcet e Copeland para ordenar, segundo o risco de subsidência, os perfis de Organossolos estudados. Os resultados mostram correlação entre os métodos (exceto Condorcet, que não foi capaz de ordenar as alternativas) e o resíduo mínimo, parâmetro usual para avaliar subsidência. Isso indica eficácia para ordenar/classificar os perfis de solos estudados quanto ao risco de subsidência. Os métodos quantitativos utilizados neste trabalho mostraram-se promissores como ferramentas em estudos na Ciência do Solo.},

  Abstract                 = {Soils contain various iron compounds that differ in solubility, reducibility and extractability. Moreover, the contribution of the various iron compounds to total iron (Fe) and total Fe concentrations differs highly among soils. As a result, the total reducible Fe content can also differ among soils, and so does the dynamics of iron reduction. These factors complicate the prediction of reducible Fe based on Fe extraction data and hamper the application of process-based models for reduced or waterlogged soils where redox processes play a key-role. This paper presents a theoretical analysis relating reducible to extractable Fe reported in the literature. Predictions made from this theoretical analysis were evaluated in soil incubations using 18 rice paddy soils from all over the world. The incubation studies and the literature study both show that reducible Fe can be related to Fe from some selected, but not all, iron extractions. The combination of measurements for labile Fe(III)oxides (derived from oxalate-extractable Fe) and stabile Fe(III)oxides (derived from dithionite-citrate-extractable Fe) shows highly significant correlations with reducible Fe with high coefficients of determination (r2 = 0.92-0.95 depending on the definition of stabile Fe(III)oxides). Given the high diversity in rice soils used for the incubations, these regression equations will have general applicability. Application of these regression equations in combination with soil database information may improve the predictive ability of process-based models where soil redox processes are important, such as CH4 emission models derived for rice paddies or wetlands.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent experience in distributed modelling has revealed that the performance of process-based erosion and hydrological models are extremely sensitive to parameter estimations and that predictions are often poor. It is also observed that quite different parameter sets may lead to very similar results and that no dbestT parameter set can be identified. In this study, we describe a dataset that offers possibilities for improved evaluation and parameterisation of spatially distributed soil erosion models. The dataset combines rainfall, runoff and sediment discharge data collected at the outlet and field surveys within the catchments that describe soil surface characteristics and soil erosion features. This offers clear advantages over traditional model evaluation as not only the simulated overall system response, integrated over time and space, but also the simulated internal system dynamics can be compared with measured data. The paper discusses and illustrates the use of the dataset to narrow uncertainties associated with model predictions.},

  Review                   = {NOTES: - This article gives support to the use of global models in GSIF; - It also suggests that finer resolution improves model performance. This occurs because coarser resolution smooths out the variation, resulting in predictions close to the mean. CRITIQUES: - Three areas (150000, 3585, 5.58 km²) with different sampling intensities (1037, 130, 152 samples). Calibration sets were: c(696, 93, 106); - Calibration and validation sets were selected by simple random sampling the original dataset. An independent validation set obtained through probability sample was not used for validation. - Predictor variables: Sand, silt and clay (compositional data) were offered to the stepwise variable selection algorithm. Satellite images were not corrected and digital numbers were used as predictors. DEM derivatives were calculated using 3x3 window size and resampled to coarse resolution (Wood (2006) has already suggested that this approach is inappropriate). Land use and vegetation are said to be poor predictors at large scales. This could be due to the original scale/resolution of these products. - Transferability among the three extents: this actually is a comparisson between interpolation (large to small area) and extrapolation (small to large area). - Transferability among the seven resolutions: layers of DEM derivatives available at different resolutions are not the same variables, but the main assumption here is that they are. - Influence of the Spatial Extent: this actually is an assessment of the influence of the feature space, not the spatial extent. Larger spatial extent results in a larger variance os soil properties (larger range). - Stepwise Variable Selection: F probability of 0.05 for including and removing variables. According to the literature (see Frank Harrell, for example), this value should be of at least 0.5. Inclusion of variables in the final model is interpreted using pedological knowledge when stepwise regression has no physical basis.}

  Abstract                 = {A Monte Carlo method is presented to study the effect of systematic and random errors on computer models mainly dealing with experimental data. It is a common assumption in this type of models (linear and nonlinear regression, and nonregression computer models) involving experimental measurements that the error sources are mainly random and independent with no constant background errors (systematic errors). However, from comparisons of different experimental data sources evidence is often found of significant bias or calibration errors. The uncertainty analysis approach presented in this work is based on the analysis of cumulative probability distributions for output variables of the models involved taking into account the effect of both types of errors. The probability distributions are obtained by performing Monte Carlo simulation coupled with appropriate definitions for the random and systematic errors. The main objectives are to detect the error source with stochastic dominance on the uncertainty propagation and the combined effect on output variables of the models. The results from the case studies analyzed show that the approach is able to distinguish which error type has a more significant effect on the performance of the model. Also, it was found that systematic or calibration errors, if present, cannot be neglected in uncertainty analysis of models dependent on experimental measurements such as chemical and physical properties. The approach can be used to facilitate decision making in fields related to safety factors selection, modeling, experimental data measurement, and experimental design.},

  Abstract                 = {S is a language and environment for data analysis originally developed at Bell Laboratories (of AT&T and now Lucent Technologies). It became the statistician's calculator for the 1990s, allowing easy access to the computing power and graphical capabilities of modern workstations and personal computers. Various implementations have been available, currently S-PLUS, a commercial system from the Insightful Corporation 1 in Seattle, and R, an Open Source system written by a team of volunteers. Both can be run on Windows and a range of UNIX / Linux operating systems: R also runs on Macintoshes. This is the fourth edition of a book which first appeared in 1994, and the S environment has grown rapidly since. This book concentrates on using the current systems to do statistics; there is a companion volume (Venables and Ripley, 2000) which discusses programming in the S language in much greater depth. Some of the more specialized functionality of the S environment is covered in on-line complements, additional sections and chapters which are available on the World Wide Web. The datasets and S functions that we use are supplied with most S environments and are also available on-line. This is not a text in statistical theory, but does cover modern statistical methodology. Each chapter summarizes the methods discussed, in order to set out the notation and the precise method implemented in S. (It will help if the reader has a basic knowledge of the topic of the chapter, but several chapters have been successfully used for specialized courses in statistical methods.) Our aim is rather to show how we analyse datasets using S. In doing so we aim to show both how S can be used and how the availability of a powerful and graphical system has altered the way we approach data analysis and allows penetrating analyses to be performed routinely. Once calculation became easy, the statistician's energies could be devoted to understanding his or her dataset. The core S language is not very large, but it is quite different from most other statistics systems. We describe the language in some detail in the first three chapters, but these are probably best skimmed at first reading. Once the philosophy of the language is grasped, its consistency and logical design will be appreciated. The chapters on applying S to statistical problems are largely self-contained, although Chapter 6 describes the language used for linear models that is used in several later chapters. We expect that most readers will want to pick and choose among the later chapters. This book is intended both for would-be users of S as an introductory guide and for class use. The level of course for which it is suitable differs from country to country, but would generally range from the upper years of an undergraduate course (especially the early chapters) to Masters' level. (For example, almost all the material is covered in the M.Sc. in Applied Statistics at Oxford.) On-line exercises (and selected answers) are provided, but these should not detract from the best exercise of all, using S to study datasets with which the reader is familiar. Our library provides many datasets, some of which are not used in the text but are there to provide source material for exercises. Nolan and Speed (2000) and Ramsey and Schafer (1997, 2002) are also good sources of exercise material.},

  Abstract                 = {The Monte Carlo technique can be used to propagate input variable uncertainty and parameter uncertainty through a model to determine output uncertainty. However, to carry out Monte Carlo simulations, the uncertainty distributions or the probability density functions (PDFs) of the model parameters and input variables must be known. This remains one of the bottlenecks in current uncertainty research in forest carbon flux modeling. Because forest carbon flux models involve many parameters, we questioned whether it is necessary to take into account all parameters in the uncertainty analysis. A sensitivity analysis can determine the parameters contributing most to the overall model output uncertainty. This paper illustrates the usefulness of the Monte Carlo simulation technique for ranking parameters for sensitivity and uncertainty in process-based forest flux models.The uncertainty of the output (net ecosystem exchange, NEE) of the FORUG model was estimated for the Hesse beech forest (1997). Based on the arbitrary uncertainty of ten key parameters, a standard deviation of 0.88 Mg C ha?1 year?1 NEE was found which is equal to 24% of the mean value of NEE. Sensitivity analysis showed that the overall output uncertainty of the FORUG model can largely be determined by accounting for the uncertainty of only a few key parameters. The results led to the identification of the key FORUG parameters and to the recommendation for a process-based description of the soil respiration process in the FORUG model.},

  Abstract                 = {Tropical deforestation and land use change is often perceived as the major cause of soil loss by water erosion and of sediment load in rivers that has a negative impact on the functioning of hydropower storage reservoirs. The Sumberjaya area in Sumatra, Indonesia is representative for con fl icts and evictions arising from this perception. The purpose of this study as part of a Negotiation Support System approach was to assess sediment yield both at plot and catchment scale and to relate it to a variety of possible clarifying factors i.e. land use, geology, soil and topography. Sediment yield at catchment scale per unit area, was found to be 3?10 times higher than soil loss measured in erosion plots. A stepwise regression showed that the dominant factors explaining sediment yield differences at catchment scale in this volcanic landscape were a particular lithology (Old Andesites) and slope angle followed by the silt fraction of the top soil. In lithologically sensitive areas soil loss at the plot scale under monoculture coffee gardens decreases over time from on average 7?11 Mg ha?1 yr?1 to 4?6 Mg ha?1 yr?1 , mainly because of the development of surface litter layers as fi lters and top soil compaction in the areas without litter, but remains higher than under shade coffee systems or forest. The runoff coef fi cient under monoculture coffee remains on average signi fi cantly higher (10?15%) than under forest (4%) or under shade coffee systems (4?7%). In lithologically stable areas soil loss remained below 1.8 Mg ha?1 yr?1 and the runoff coef fi cient below 2.5% under all land use types, even bare soil plots or monoculture coffee gardens. Less than 20% of the catchment area produces almost 60% of the sediment yield. The reduction of negative off-site effects on e.g. the life time of a storage reservoir would bene fi t greatly from an improved assessment of the lithologies in volcanic landscapes and the consideration of potential sediment source and sink areas. In lithologically sensitive areas, a shift from sun to shade coffee systems may result in reducing surface runoff and soil loss, although water erosion at the plot scale is not the main contributor to sediment yield at the catchment scale. The quanti fi cation of land use effects on dominant erosive processes such as river bank and river bed erosion, landslides and the concentrated fl ow erosion on footpaths and roads can contribute to more targeted efforts and relevant incentives to reduce (or live with) sediment load of the rivers.},

The ordination diagrams of species and samples were a good reflection of ecological variation in the area. The data were used to draw sample standard deviation ellipses around the average ILU score.

  Abstract                 = {Remote sensing from satellite or airborne platforms of land or sea surfaces in the visible and near infrared is strongly affected by the presence of the atmosphere along the path from Sun to target (surface) to sensor. This paper presents 6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), a computer code which can accurately simulate the above problems. The 6S code is an improved version of 5S (Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum), developed by the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique ten years ago. The new version now permits calculations of near-nadir (down-looking) aircraft observations, accounting for target elevation, non lambertian surface conditions, and new absorbing species (CH4, N2O, CO). The computational accuracy for Rayleigh and aerosol scattering effects has been improved by the use of state-of-the-art approximations and implementation of the successive order of scattering (SOS) algorithm. The step size (resolution) used for spectral integration has been improved to 2.5 nm. The goal of this paper is not to provide a complete description of the methods used as that information is detailed in the 6S manual, but rather to illustrate the impact of the improvements between 5S and 6S by examining some typical remote sensing situations. Nevertheless, the 6S code has still limitations. It cannot handle spherical atmosphere and as a result, it cannot be used for limb observations. In addition, the decoupling the authors are using for absorption and scattering effects does not allow to use the code in presence of strong absorption bands},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:It has generally been argued that parametric statistics should not be applied to data with non-normal distributions. Empirical research has demonstrated that Mann-Whitney generally has greater power than the t-test unless data are sampled from the normal. In the case of randomized trials, we are typically interested in how an endpoint, such as blood pressure or pain, changes following treatment. Such trials should be analyzed using ANCOVA, rather than t-test. The objectives of this study were: a) to compare the relative power of Mann-Whitney and ANCOVA; b) to determine whether ANCOVA provides an unbiased estimate for the difference between groups; c) to investigate the distribution of change scores between repeat assessments of a non-normally distributed variable.METHODS:Polynomials were developed to simulate five archetypal non-normal distributions for baseline and post-treatment scores in a randomized trial. Simulation studies compared the power of Mann-Whitney and ANCOVA for analyzing each distribution, varying sample size, correlation and type of treatment effect (ratio or shift).RESULTS:Change between skewed baseline and post-treatment data tended towards a normal distribution. ANCOVA was generally superior to Mann-Whitney in most situations, especially where log-transformed data were entered into the model. The estimate of the treatment effect from ANCOVA was not importantly biased.CONCLUSION:ANCOVA is the preferred method of analyzing randomized trials with baseline and post-treatment measures. In certain extreme cases, ANCOVA is less powerful than Mann-Whitney. Notably, in these cases, the estimate of treatment effect provided by ANCOVA is of questionable interpretability.},

  Abstract                 = {Os solos derivados de rochas serpentinizadas ou serpentinitos constituem um grupo especial de solos em toda superfície terrestre. De caráter ultramáfico, ou seja, rochas com mais de 70 % de minerais máficos (ferromagnesianos), os serpentinitos apresentam uma mineralogia pobre em sílica e escassa em Al, sendo, no entanto, muito enriquecida em Mg. São poucos os estudos sobre a morfologia, mineralogia, gênese e classificação dos solos desenvolvidos de tais rochas. Em ambiente tropical úmido no sudoeste de Minas Gerais, na zona do greenstone belt do Morro de Ferro, em superfícies geomórficas jovens, três perfis de solos representativos dessa paisagem sobre rochas serpentinizadas foram caracterizados por meio de descrições macro e micromorfológicas, análises granulométricas, químicas e por mineralogia de raios X das frações argila e silte. Complementarmente, para acompanhamento da alteração geoquímica dos horizontes do solo, foram feitas microanálises das seções delgadas por EDRX. Os solos foram classificados como Chernossolo Háplico Férrico típico, Cambissolo Háplico eutroférrico léptico e Neossolo Regolítico eutrófico típico e, embora situados num clima que favorece o rápido intemperismo, do ponto de vista morfológico e mineralógico, mostraram-se similares aos solos derivados de rochas serpentinizadas das regiões subtropicais e temperada. No processo de formação de solo, a evolução da trama segue a seguinte seqüência: alteração da rocha ? trama frâgmica ? trama porfírica com cavidades ? trama porfírica aberta por coalescência de cavidades. O processo de argiluviação é evidente e se dá em dois estádios distintos: argiluviação primária, que ocorre nas fendas e cavidades que se formam por alteração de rocha, e argiluviação secundária, verificada na porosidade mais aberta e evoluída da coalescência das cavidades. Os solos apresentam mineralogia pouco comum para solos tropicais, com presença de minerais primários de fácil decomposição até mesmo na fração argila, com destaque para o talco, clorita trioctaedral e ocorrência limitada de tremolita, sendo esta última abundante na fração silte. Óxidos de Fe, caulinita e os interestratificados de clorita-esmectita e de clorita-vermiculita completam a assembléia mineralógica. A tendência de evolução é para B textural ou para B nítico com mineralogia 1:1 e alto conteúdo de óxidos de Fe. Nas ases iniciais de alteração, os alteromorfos já apresentam composição química similar aos agregados do solo, com forte perda de Mg, Ca e Si e acúmulo relativo de Al e Fe. Nas três situações estudadas, ocorreu um rejuvenescimento superficial por erosão diferencial, que acumulou material grosseiro e removeu os finos, contribuindo para o incremento da relação textural.},

  Abstract                 = {Quando uma determinada propriedade varia de um local para outro com algum grau de organização ou continuidade, expresso pela dependência espacial, a estatística clássica deve ser abandonada e dar lugar a uma estatística relativamente nova: a geoestatística. Por estatística clássica entende-se aquela que utiliza parâmetros como média e desvio padrão para representar um fenômeno, e baseia-se na hipótese principal de que as variações de um local para outro são aleatórias. Desse modo, esses dois ramos da estatística têm validade de aplicação em condições perfeitamente distintas. Para se determinar qual das duas deve ser usada em cada caso, utiliza-se o semivariograma que expressa a dependência espacial entre as amostras. Havendo dependência espacial, pode-se estimar valores da propriedade em estudo para os locais não amostrados dentro do campo, sem tendenciosidade e com variância mínima, pelo método denominado krigagem. Além disso, muitas vezes, duas propriedades correlacionam-se entre si e no espaço, e uma é mais difícil ou mais cara para se medir no campo. A dependência espacial entre duas propriedades no espaço pode ser expressa pelo semivariograma cruzado, e se ele existir, o método chamado co-krigagem pode ser utilizado para estimar aquela mais difícil de se medir, utilizando-se os dados de ambas. Estes métodos oferecem a escolha de se medir a propriedade mais difícil com um número mínimo possível. A construção de mapas de contornos (isolinhas), e o delineamento de espaçamento e disposição ótima de amostras no campo são outras aplicações imediatas. Neste trabalho procurou-se dar o maior detalhamento possível nos aspectos teóricos e nos conceitos básicos de geoestatística, numa linguagem simples e compreensível ao leitor. Para ilustrar, utilizaram-se dados da literatura, como exemplo aplicativo para propriedades químicas de solo. Os dados e os programas de geoestatística utilizados estão listados em apêndice no final do trabalho.},

  Abstract                 = {Spatial variability has been a concern of agricultural research since the beginning of this century (Smith, 1910; Montgomery, 1913; Waynick & Sharp, 1919; Harris, 1920). Geostatistical procedures were first used in the mining engineering field in South Africa (Krige, 1951). Later, it was put into theory in France (Matheron, 1963). Fifteen years later it was being used in the Soil Science and is extensively used up to now (Campbell, 1978; Vieira, 1979; Hajrasuliha et al., 1980; Burgess & Webster, 1980; Vieira et al., 1981; Vauclin et al., 1982; Vieira, 1982; Vieira et al., 1983; Vauclin et al., 1983; Vieira & Hatfield, 1984; Reichardt et al., 1986; Vieira et al., 1987; Vieira et al., 1988). There have been studies to demystify variability in general (Reichardt et al., 1986), to find new alternative uses and simplifications (Vieira et al., 1997) and to determine the limitations on the uses and advantages of kriging with respect to other methods (Warrick et al. 1988). Geostatistical procedures are powerful tools to study spatial variability. Sampling and analyzing adequately through geostatistics can disclose information about the data not normally revealed by other methods. Moreover, for large areas such as a province or a watershed, kriging still represents the best method of interpolation for the construction of isarithmic or three-dimensional maps. The objective of this paper is to make available computer programs, relevant comments and details involved in each step of geostatistical calculation.},

Objetivou-se com este trabalho estudar a variabilidade espacial de atributos físicos do solo em uma microbacia hidrográfica, visando subsidiar estudos de manejo do solo e da água. A área em estudo é uma microbacia que pode ser considerada homogênea para estudos com agentes erosivos, como a precipitação, devido ao tamanho reduzido (1,23 ha), mas de grande variabilidade de respostas à erosão, em função dos atributos do solo, vegetação, histórico de uso e relevo. Com o auxílio de SIG, DGPS e estação total, toda área foi dividida em grid retangular de 20 m, onde o solo foi amostrado em duas camadas, 0 a 20 cm e 20 a 40 cm. Os atributos avaliados foram: teores de areia, silte e argila e argila dispersa em água (ADA). Os resultados foram analisados utilizando-se a estatística básica, como histogramas e assimetria, e geoestatística, por meio de semivariogramas e mapas de krigagem. Houve dependência espacial de todos os atributos analisados, especialmente na camada de 20 a 40 cm.},

  Abstract                 = {High-resolution digital soil mapping for applications like precision agriculture requires the collection of good-quality high spatial resolution information. Conventional soil analysis is expensive, time consuming and laborious. The development of proximal soil sensors to lessen the need for or to complement conventional soil analysis is important. Although proximal sensing may produce results that are not as accurate as conventional laboratory analysis, they allow for the collection of larger amounts of data using simpler, cheaper and less laborious techniques. This forms the rationale for proximal soil sensing. This article deals with indirect measurements of soil organic carbon (OC) and iron (Fe) contents using soil colour as the proxy. Measurements of soil colour were made using a digital camera. The RGB tristimuli were transformed to variables from other colour space models and a redness index (RI) and these were used to derive pedotransfer functions for soil OC and Fe. Predictions using univariate as well as full factorial regressions (FFR) of these tristimuli were compared to predictions using visible-near infrared (vis-NIR: 400-1100 nm) spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) and a reduced number of wavelengths selected using the variable importance for projection (VIP) with PLSR (VIP-PLSR). For predictions of soil OC content, the VIP-PLSR technique produced predictions with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.91 and 0.46%. These were only very slightly better than predictions by an FFR of the CIELa*b* tristimuli (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.48%) and PLSR (R2adj. of 0.91 and an RMSE of 0.50%). Predictions using the logarithmic regression of the CIEv* variable were least accurate with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.88 and 0.56%. For predictions of Fe, an FFR of the CIELc*h* tristimuli produced an R2adj. of 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.068%, which was better than those obtained by PLSR (R2adj. values of 0.64 and RMSE 0.074%) and VIP-PLSR (R2adj. of 0.64 and 0.075%). Predictions of Fe using the logarithmic regression of the RI produced the least accurate results with R2adj. and RMSE values of 0.56 and 0.081%. In this study, we showed that a digital camera can be used for fast, accurate and non-destructive measurements of soil colour and predictions of soil OC and Fe contents in Brittany, France.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent advances in on-the-go soil sensing, terrain modelling and yield mapping have made available large quantities of information about the within-field variability of soil and crop properties. But the selection of the key variables for an identification of management zones, required for precision agriculture, is not straightforward. To investigate a procedure for this selection, an 8 ha agricultural field in the Loess belt of Belgium was considered for this study. The available information consisted of: (i) top- and subsoil samples taken at 110 locations, on which soil properties: textural fractions, organic carbon (OC), CaCO3 and pH were analysed, (ii) soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) obtained through an electromagnetic induction based sensor, and (iii) wetness index, stream power index and steepest slope angle derived from a detailed digital elevation model (DEM). A principal component analysis, involving 12 soil and topographic properties and two ECa variables, identified three components explaining 67.4% of the total variability. These three components were best represented by pH, ECa that strongly associated with texture and OC. However, OC was closely related to some more readily obtainable topographic properties, and therefore elevation was preferred. A fuzzy k-means classification of these three variables produced four potential management classes. Three-year average standardized yield maps of grain and straw showed productivity differences across these classes, but mainly linked to their landscape position. In the loess area with complex soil-landscape interactions pH, ECa and elevation can be considered as key properties to delineate potential management classes.},

  Abstract                 = {After a brief review on hydromorphic phenomena and concepts of gley aod pseudogley in literature, examples of these phenomena and their consequences are presented in soils affected by an excess of water in tropical regions. Morphological features, water regime and iron dynamics have been studied in inundable soils of the plain of Logone-Chari (Chad Basin]. In t h e s e soils excess of water occurs during the rainy season (may-October). Characteristic features of gley and pseudogley are observed in different horizons. Seasonal dynamic is noted in t h e s e soils : variations of t h e porosity due t o swelling and consolidation or compaction in saturated conditions - water regime with seasonal alternation of soil saturation and desiccation - iron dynamics. In these acid soils, particular iron redistribution is the most visible consequence of hydromorphic phenomena. Iron dynamics is influenced by many factors : duration of the excess of water, continuity or discontinuity of the saturation, water movements in waterlogged soils, quantity and quality of organic matter, pH ... Formation of the most visible morphological features can be xplained by the intensity of different processes occuring in iron dynamics (reduction and mobilization, oxidation and immo- bilization - see table]. So, it appears that relationships can be easily established between morphological features and soil forming processes. The gley formation is particulary influenced by mobilization phenomena and the pseudogley formation by immobilization ones. On the other hand, relationships don?t appear easy to establish between morphological features and one or several factors affecting iron dynamic$, such a s conditions in which soils are under excess of water and especially duration of the saturation.},

  Abstract                 = {A method for mapping soil properties at a regional scale with acceptable precision and cost was investigated. It combines soil classification and interpolation, and uses sample information from a reference area and simple soil observations over the region. The method consists of two stages. First is the prediction of soil properties at a set of sites covering the region by classifying each site according to the soil classification of the reference area, and then by assigning to each site the values of soil properties measured at the representative profile of its soil class. The second is by interpolating the predictions of the properties from the classes at the observation sites. Three methods were considered: kriging, inverse squared distance and nearest neighbour. The performance of classification combined with interpolation was evaluated for mapping water content at wilting point in an area of 1736 ha in a physiographic region of Southern France. The method was compared with conventional methods, namely kriging with actual data and prediction from a soil map at a scale of 1:100000. Estimates from classification combined with kriging were more precise than those from the 1:1OOOOO soil map in all instances, and close to those of ordinary kriging with actual data when prediction points were near the observation points. Classification combined with inverse squared distance or with nearest neighbour interpolation was always less precise than classification with kriging. However, it was more precise than classification at the 1:100 000 scale except when prediction points were far from the observation points.},

  Abstract                 = {Physically- and biochemically-distinct fractions of soil organic matter (SOM) can be separated by density to yield: (i) low-density plant detritus fraction easily separable from soil minerals (f-LF), (ii) low-density materials strongly associated with minerals (m-LF), and (iii) high-density fraction (HF) rich in microbially-processed organic matter strongly associated with minerals. The factors controlling the pool size and chemistry in these fractions, especially those in m-LF, are unclear. We examined the influence of climate and parent material on SOM in these fractions using two sets of forest soils (0-10 cm mineral horizon) developed from contrasting parent materials (metasedimentary vs. ultrabasic igneous rock) along an altitudinal gradient in Mt. Kinabalu, Borneo. From 700 m to upper altitudes (1700, 2700 m), where mean annual temperature decreases from 24 to 12 °C with roughly constant rainfall, surface soil C stocks on both parent materials increased from 2.6-2.8 to 5.4-7.5 kg m- 2 with progressively greater proportions in m-LF and, to less extent, fresher plant detritus fractions. In HF, C and N concentrations increased with altitude though their stocks were roughly constant due to progressively lower bulk density. Labile C assessed by laboratory incubation of bulk soils correlated better with C concentrations in the two LF pools than in HF, especially at the lowest altitude where most SOM is strongly associated with minerals as HF. These results suggest that LF pools are more labile and more sensitive to altitude-induced, climate differences as compared to the HF pool that is protected by the mineral matrix. The C:N ratios of HF on metasedimentary rock increased with altitude (11 to 17) while those on ultrabasic rock remained essentially constant (14-15), implying interactive influence of altitude and parent material on stoichiometry. Unusually high C:N and alkyl-C in m-LF were found in mid-altitude soils, suggesting selective preservation of inherently recalcitrant materials in addition to, or instead of, mineral coating or aggregate occlusion of partially-degraded LF by microbial metabolites.},

  Abstract                 = {In the Miombo Woodlands Region of south-central Africa, it is estimated 50?80% of the total system?s carbon stock is found in the top 1.5 m belowground. Deforestation and rapid population growth rates have led to reduced fallow periods and widespread land degradation in the south-central Africa area of the Miombo Woodlands. The impact of this land use conversion on belowground carbon and nitrogen stocks within the Miombo Woodlands has not been examined extensively in the past. We addressed how the soil carbon pro?le reacts to conversion to agriculture, the continuation of agriculture, and the ability of the soil carbon budget to recover following abandonment within the Chimaliro Forest Reserve and surrounding villages in Kasungu, Malawi. Protected natural Miombo Woodlands sites, agricultural ?elds of increasing ages, and fallow ?elds of increasing ages were sampled. Surface carbon levels in Miombo soils varied from 1.2 to 3.7%. Agricultural soil carbon was signi?cantly depressed with surface layers ranging from 0.35 to 1.2% carbon. Unexpectedly, fallow carbon and nitrogen levels continued to be signi?cantly repressed (surface soils 0.65?2.3% C), pointing out the possible unsustainability of the current agricultural management cycle dominant in the area. On average, agricultural soils contain 40% less soil carbon than the natural Miombo Woodlands. Soil carbon declined logarithmically with depth within all land use types. Clay content was signi?cantly positively correlated with soil carbon in the top 40 cm and therefore areas of higher clay content contained elevated carbon levels. Although a common attribute to many agricultural systems, bulk densities were not signi?cantly altered by land use changes.},

  Abstract                 = { The aim of this paper is to provide a conceptual basis for the systematic treatment of uncertainty in model-based decision support activities such as policy analysis, integrated assessment and risk assessment. It focuses on the uncertainty perceived from the point of view of those providing information to support policy decisions (i.e., the modellers’ view on uncertainty) – uncertainty regarding the analytical outcomes and conclusions of the decision support exercise. Within the regulatory and management sciences, there is neither commonly shared terminology nor full agreement on a typology of uncertainties. Our aim is to synthesise a wide variety of contributions on uncertainty in model-based decision support in order to provide an interdisciplinary theoretical framework for systematic uncertainty analysis. To that end we adopt a general definition of uncertainty as being any deviation from the unachievable ideal of completely deterministic knowledge of the relevant system. We further propose to discriminate among three dimensions of uncertainty: location, level and nature of uncertainty, and we harmonise existing typologies to further detail the concepts behind these three dimensions of uncertainty. We propose an uncertainty matrix as a heuristic tool to classify and report the various dimensions of uncertainty, thereby providing a conceptual framework for better communication among analysts as well as between them and policymakers and stakeholders. Understanding the various dimensions of uncertainty helps in identifying, articulating, and prioritising critical uncertainties, which is a crucial step to more adequate acknowledgement and treatment of uncertainty in decision support endeavours and more focused research on complex, inherently uncertain, policy issues. },

This approach has been criticised because the information taken into account was not explicitly specified and validation procedures were not developed. We advocate that pedological knowledge of soil landscape distribution, soil-forming factors and soil processes is essential to modern soil spatial analysis and may be rigorously integrated into soil mapping. Basic reasons for such integration are an increase in prediction efficiency and also the necessity to link soil maps to dynamic modelling, enabling risk assessment and impact studies. Several approaches are reviewed including spatial prediction techniques using existing soil maps and spatial modelling based on soil-forming factors. Combination in the near future of space and time modelling demands additional integration of the dynamics of physical and biochemical soil processes. },

  Abstract                 = {This article explores the use of spatial point-process analysis as an aid to describe topsoil lead distribution in urban environments. The data used were collected in Glebe, an inner suburb of Sydney. The approach focuses on the locations of punctual events defining a point pattern, which can be statistically described through local intensity estimates and between-point distance functions. F-, G- and K-surfaces of a marked spatial point pattern were described and used to estimate nearest distance functions over a sliding band of quantiles belonging to the marking variable. This provided a continuous view of the point pattern properties as a function of the marking variable. Several random fields were simulated by selecting points from random, clustered or regular point processes and diffusing them. Recognition of the underlying point process using variograms derived from dense sampling was difficult because, structurally, the variograms were very similar. Point-event distance functions were useful complimentary tools that, in most cases, enabled clear recognition of the clustered processes. Spatial sampling quantile point pattern analysis was defined and applied to the Glebe data set. The analysis showed that the highest lead concentrations were strongly clustered. The comparison of this data set with the simulation confidence limits of a Poisson process, a short-radius clustered point process and a geostatistical simulation showed a random process for the third quartile of lead concentrations but strong clustering for the data in the upper quartile. Thus the distribution of topsoil lead concentrations over Glebe may have resulted from several contamination processes, mainly from regular or random processes with large diffusion ranges and short-range clustered processes for the hot spots. Point patterns with the same characteristics as the Glebe experimental pattern could be generated by separate additive geostatistical simulation. Spatial sampling quantile point patterns statistics can, in an easy and accurate way, be used complementarily with geostatistical methods. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Therefore, compositional kriging is introduced as a straightforward extension of ordinary kriging that complies with these constraints. In two case studies, the performance of compositional kriging is compared with that of the additive logratio-transform. In the first case study, compositional kriging yielded significantly more accurate predictions than the additive logratio-transform, while in the second case study the performances were comparable.},

  Abstract                 = {Phytoremediation is a potential cleanup technology for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated soils. Bidens maximowicziana is a new Pb hyperaccumulator, which not only has remarkable tolerance to Pb but also extraordinary accumulation capacity for Pb. The maximum Pb concentration was 1509.3 mg/kg in roots and 2164.7 mg/kg in overground tissues. The Pb distribution order in the B. maximowicziana was: leaf > stem > root. The e?ect of amendments on phytoremediation was also studied. The mobility of soil Pb and the Pb concentrations in plants were both increased by EDTA application. Compared with CK (control check), EDTA application promoted translocation of Pb to overground parts of the plant. The Pb concentrations in overground parts of plants was increased from 24.23?680.56 mg/kg to 29.07?1905.57 mg/kg. This research demonstrated that B. maximowicziana appeared to be suitable for phytoremediation of Pb contaminated soil, especially, combination with EDTA.},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding of the characteristics of soil organic matter (SOM) and soil nutrients at the field and catchment scale is important for refining agricultural management practices and for improving sustainable land use. In order to analyze on SOM and nutrient differences among different land use types and their relationships between land use, landscape position and slope aspect, 94 sampling sites including 7 land uses were selected along 6 transects in the Danangou catchment with an area of 3.5 km2 on the Loess Plateau of China. Significant differences in SOM, total N (TN), available N (AN) and available P (AP) among these land uses were found. Higher values in SOM, TN and AN were measured in soils from woodland and grassland, but lower values in the soils from fallow land and cropland. Compare SOM and TN with cropland, intercropping land had high contents. The adjusted R2 values of regression models for SOM and nutrients with land use, landscape position and slope aspect ranged from 0.501 (SOM) to 0.134 (AP). A comparison between average predicted and measured values for SOM and each soil nutrient revealed that the predicted values in TP and AN for each land use, in SOM and TN except for fallow land and in AP except for intercropping land, shrub land and woodland, fell with in a 95% confidence interval about the measured values. The simplified predicted models of soil nutrients combined with the key value of SOM for soil quality can serve to improve agricultural practices and to provide useful information on sustainable land use. Improvement in SOM and nutrients would be expected from more C inputs including manure and crop residues and alternative cultivation practices such as developing intercropping system, building terrace for soil and water conservation, return the cropland with SOM content less than a key value of 0.44% to the grassland and woodland on the hilly areas similar to the Loess Plateau of China. At the same time, it is recommended that nitrogen fertilization addition could be decreased in the foot slope and increased on the upper slope.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil is being eroded from the village lands of Fandou Be?ri, in southwestern Niger, at rates of over 30 t ha 1 year 1, as measured by the 137Cs method. These figures exceed those that were used to label the Sahel a ??hot spot?? for soil erosion. The response to these data in international agronomic research organisations has been to make large investments in soil erosion research, but this contrasts with the meagre relative commitment to the problem by local Djerma (Zarma) and Fulani farmers. Farmers are more concerned about the loss of fertility than the loss of soil, per se, a viewpoint that embeds decisions about land use and conservation in a much broader decision-making process. Practices like paillage (laying of millet stalks) could be interpreted as tacit acknowledgement of erosion, but they have many other purposes. We ask, who is correct in their assessment of erosion? the villagers or the agronomists? By comparing scientific evidence, local views and measurements of erosion, we conclude that the farmers? opinions are a valid contribution to a complex argument that consists of short-, medium- and long-term issues. Short-term effects are acknowledged by both farmers and scientists. They include sand blasting of young crops, the burial or exposure of crops by floods or windstorms, and the removal of organic matter and nutrients. However, the amounts and values of the losses incurred in these ways are difficult to establish. In the medium term, significant losses of water- and nutrient-holding capacity only occur where erosion has drastically reduced soil thickness, but this affects very few fields. We believe that most of the soils in Fandou Be?ri are deep sands that can withstand many years of erosion before they lose significant production capacity. The longer-term issue is whether farmers should be asked to conserve soil for some abstract and distant purpose? The negative effects of erosion, at whatever scale, must be balanced against the maintenance of a community that depends on a holistically conceived system of risk-avoidance agriculture in which erosion may be unavoidable, given the current constraints of labour and the imperative to get a crop each year in the face of variable and unpredictable rainfall. The imposition of a rigorous system of soil conservation might threaten the cohesion of the community. Only a more open and productive debate between the scientific community, the state, and farmers can reach a more satisfactory framing of the ?erosion problem?.},

  Abstract                 = {Presence-only data, point locations where a species has been recorded as being present, are often used in modeling the distribution of a species as a function of a set of explanatory variables - whether to map species occurrence, to understand its association with the environment, or to predict its response to environmental change. Currently, ecologists most commonly analyze presence-only data by adding randomly chosen “pseudo-absences” to the data such that it can be analyzed using logistic regression, an approach which has weaknesses in model speciﬁcation, in interpretation, and in implementation. To address these issues, we propose Poisson point process modeling of the intensity of presences. We also derive a link between the proposed approach and logistic regression - speciﬁcally, we show that as the number of pseudo-absences increases (in a regular or uniform random arrangement), logistic regression slope parameters and their standard errors converge to those of the corresponding Poisson point process model. We discuss the practical implications of these results. In particular, point process modeling oﬀers a framework for choice of the number and location of pseudo-absences, both of which are currently chosen by ad hoc and sometimes ineﬀective methods in ecology, a point which we illustrate by example.},

By subtracting the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net radiation at the surface we are left with a “residual” energy flux that is used for evapotranspiration (i.e. energy that is used to convert the liquid water into water vapor). This manual describes the theoretical basis of SEBAL using images from Landsat 5 and 7 satellites.

Entretanto, são poucas as referências em relação à quantificação destas cargas, principalmente em solos ácricos, que representam o extremo na escala de intemperismo. Neste estudo, foram determinadas as cargas permanentes e as variáveis de dois Latossolos Vermelhos acriférricos, um Latossolo Amarelo ácrico e um Latossolo Amarelo acriférrico, que foram comparados a um Nitossolo Vermelho eutroférrico, com carga predominantemente permanente. As amostras foram investigadas pelo método da adsorção do íon césio (Cs + ), que mede a carga estrutural permanente (????? o ) e baseia-se na preferência do Cs + sobre o Li + na superfície da siloxana de grupos de superfície ionizáveis de menor seletividade ao íon Cs + . A carga variável representou mais que 50 % da carga total dos solos estudados. Dois dos quatro Latossolos com propriedades ácricas exibiram quantidade significativa de carga permanente, provavelmente em razão da presença de vermiculita com hidróxi entrecamadas e clorita. A quantidade de carga permanente apresentada pelo Nitossolo foi até cinco vezes maior se comparada à dos Latossolos, o que pode ser atribuído à diferença na constituição mineralógica. O método da adsorção de Cs foi capaz de identificar teores significativos de carga permanente estrutural, mesmo em solos com baixo teor de minerais 2:1.},

  Abstract                 = {Pedometrics, essentially the application of probability and statistics to soil, has its origins in agronomy in the early part of this century. For several decades it was a tool for designing experiments and surveys and in advisory work. It burgeoned in the 1960s for predicting soil properties at remote sites, for creating and analysing classifications, and for exploring multivariate relations. The 1970s brought a reappraisal, leading to changes of classifying strategy from hierarchical to non-hierarchical and to a new appreciation of the nature of soil variation itself. Pedometricians began to treat soil properties as spatially correlated random processes and to tap the richness of geostatistics for analysis and prediction. Image-analysing computers have brought new opportunities for analysing soil structure, especially that of the pores, their sizes, shapes, and topology. There is still a need to relate the directly observed porous structure to hydraulics and mechanical behaviour of soil. Fractals may have a role. To a more limited degree pedometrics has helped in elucidating pedogenesis by quantifying relations between individual soil properties and controlling factors. Solving the full system of multivariate equations needed to describe the products of soil genesis in individual regions, let alone globally, remains one of the biggest challenges for pedometricians. Advanced pedometric techniques and the theory on which they are based now exceed the comprehension of many soil scientists. It is time to teach the subject from sound and clear expository texts.},

A regression equation may be used to express a functional relation between two soil variables that are thought to be related by some simple mathematical law but only when one of the variables is known exactly. In most other circumstances regression is inappropriate. Where departures from a functional relation are a result of errors of measurement and sampling fluctuation it should be replaced by a structural analysis to find the best equation. Where the underlying relation is truly bivariate it should be described as such.},

It distinguishes variance and standard deviation for measuring dispersion from standard error to indicate confidence in estimates of means. It describes the strictly limited context in which to use the coefficient of variation. It stresses the importance of quoting means and differences between them in contrast to statistical significance, which is at best of secondary interest. It guides readers to inspect and explore their data before deciding to transform them for analysis and illustrates what can be achieved by taking logarithms of single variates and by principal component analysis of multivariate data.},

It is only the beginning, however. From it, follow the standard errors (SEs) of means, SEs of differences and other effects provided by experiments, which in turn lead to tests of significance. Use the simple least significant difference (LSD) at some acceptable probability for testing comparisons of individual means. Do not use experiment-wise multiple comparison tests. In experiments with graded treatments do not make multiple comparisons of any kind; instead fit a response curve and analyse the data by regression. Sampling fluctuation within experimental units and surveys contributes short-range variation to the residual variance of measured soil properties and increases errors. Diminish this contribu- tion either by replicate sampling and measurement within plots or by bulking before measurement. Sample all replicates in the field; sampling in the laboratory (pseudo-replication) is no substitute. In almost all investigations the mean values for experimental treatments and survey classes are the most important outcomes. So report them with their SEs; readers will then be able to make of them what they will.},

The eighty-four sampling sites were classified numerically to produce a hierarchy, and the classes of the upper part of the hierarchy mapped. The mapped classes became increasingly fragmented as the number of classes increased. At the 3-class level, the classes corresponded to character space clusters and class fragmentation was not serious. Principal-component analysis of the sample data yielded a first component that accounted for 40 per cent of the total variance and well represented the field characters used for soil classification. An isarithm map of the first component shows how the soil changes gradually over the landscape in good agreement with a soil-series map made by free survey.},

It is usually solved by fitting plausible models to the sample variogram by weighted least squares approximation. The residual sum of squares can always be diminished, and the fit improved in that sense, by adding parameters to the model. A satisfactory compromise between goodness of fit and parsimony can be achieved by applying the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For a given set of data the variable part of the AIC is estimated by where n is the number of experimental points on the variogram, R is the residual sum of squares and p is the number of parameters in the model. The model to choose is the one for which Â is least.The AIC is closely related to Akaike's earlier final prediction error and the Schwarz criterion. It is also equivalent to an F test when adding parameters in nested models.},

Approximate confidence intervals for the variogram of a soil property can be found numerically by simulating a large field of values using a plausible model and then taking many samples from it and computing the observed variogram of each sample. A sampling distribution of the variogram and its percentiles can then be obtained. When this is done for situations typical in soil and environmental surveys it seems that variograms computed on fewer than 50 data are of little value and that at least 100 data are needed. Our experiments suggest that for a normally distributed isotropic variable a variogram computed from a sample of 150 data might often be satisfactory, while one derived from 225 data will usually be reliable.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are representations of topography with inherent errors that constitute uncertainty. DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. A method for simulating uncertainty that is implemented as an extension for the ArcView/Spatial Analyst GIS environment was developed. Users can evaluate DEM uncertainty using DEM metadata and spatial characteristics of the DEM. Monte-Carlo simulation techniques were used to represent DEM uncertainty and its effect on various topographic parameters (slope, upslope area, and the topographic index) often used in hydrologic analyses. Different methods for representing error and quantifying uncertainty were investigated.},

  Abstract                 = {{A survey of digital elevation model (DEM) users was conducted to investigate how respondents use elevation data and how they perceive and address DEM uncertainty arising from unknown error in the elevation data. The information reported here is based on 216 survey responses received between June 4, 1998 and June 4, 2000. DEM users from 26 countries and various organizations and industries participated in the survey. Half of the respondents recognized that their work is \^{A} ? sometimes\^{A}? or \^{A} ? always\^{A}? affected by uncertainty, and 55 indicated that uncertainty is \^{A} ? very important\^{A}? or \^{A} ? somewhat important.\^{A}? Respondents reported that they would spend a minimum amount of time to assess DEM uncertainty. The methods used by the small group of respondents who \^{A} ? always\^{A}? account for uncertainty (21\%) were varied. There does not appear to be consistent procedures for addressing uncertainty among the community of DEM users. The effects of DEM uncertainty should be explicit, and procedures for addressing it should be consistent so that conclusions from DEM-based analyses take uncertainty into account.}},

  Abstract                 = {Digital elevation models (DEMs) represent the topography that drives surface flow and are arguably one of the more important data sources for deriving variables used by numerous hydrologic models. A considerable amount of research has been conducted to address uncertainty associated with error in digital elevation models (DEMs) and the propagation of error to derived terrain parameters. This review brings together a discussion of research in fundamental topical areas related to DEM uncertainty that affect the use of DEMs for hydrologic applications. These areas include: (a) DEM error; (b) topographic parameters frequently derived from DEMs and the associated algorithms used to derive these parameters; (c) the influence of DEM scale as imposed by grid cell resolution; (d) DEM interpolation; and (e) terrain surface modification used to generate hydrologically-viable DEM surfaces. Each of these topical areas contributes to DEM uncertainty and may potentially influence results of distributed parameter hydrologic models that rely on DEMs for the derivation of input parameters. The current state of research on methods developed to quantify DEM uncertainty is reviewed. Based on this review, implications of DEM uncertainty and suggestions for the GIS research and user communities are offered.},

DEM data are often used in analyses without quantifying the effects of these errors. This paper describes a Monte Carlo methodology for evaluation of the effects of uncertainty on elevation and derived topographic parameters. Four methods for representing DEM uncertainty that utilize meta-data and spatial characteristics of a DEM are presented. Seven statistics derived from simulation results were used to quantify the effect of DEM error. When uncertainty was quantified by the average relative absolute difference, elevation did not deviate. The range of deviation across the four methods for slope was 5 to 8 percent, 460 to 950 percent for derived catchment areas and 4 to 9 percent for the topographic index. This research demonstrates how application of this methodology can address DEM uncertainty, contributing to more responsible use of elevation and derived topographic parameters, and ultimately results obtained from their use.},

Using bootstrap confidence intervals for the regression vectors, it is possible to select a subset of the original variables to include in the regression, yielding a more parsimonious model with smaller prediction errors.

  Abstract                 = {A erosão acelerada do solo, um processo basicamente induzido pela ação antrópica, muito contribui para a degradação da qualidade das terras aráveis em todo o mundo, além de constituir a principal fonte não pontual de poluição dos recursos hídricos superficiais. Considerando a demanda efetiva pelo desenvolvimento de indicadores para avaliação do impacto da erosão na qualidade do solo em sistemas de produção agrícola, este trabalho teve por objetivo desenvolver um índice, com valor prognóstico, para ser aplicado como uma ferramenta de planejamento na interpretação da tolerância de perda de solo em áreas agrícolas. Foi desenvolvido o método designado ?Índice de Tempo de Vida do Solo?, para se proceder ao diagnóstico da erosão em uma área predominantemente utilizada com a cultura da cana-de-açúcar no município de Piracicaba (SP). Na realização do trabalho, foram empregados geotécnicas e métodos de análise geoestatística, sendo o processamento e a análise dos dados efetivados em ambiente de sistema de informação geográfica do tipo matricial. As taxas anuais médias de perda de solo foram estimadas em trabalho anterior, empregando a equação universal de perda de solo (EUPS), com ajuste dos fatores do modelo às condições locais da área de estudo. Nos cálculos do índice de tempo de vida do solo, foi presumida uma taxa de renovação de 0,2 mm ano -1 e foram analisadas duas profundidades, de 50 e de 100 cm, consideradas mínimas para o uso agrícola. A avaliação da espessura do solum revelou que, na área de estudo, predominam solos pouco profundos, com médias ponderadas pelas áreas de ocorrência de 78 cm, solos ocupados com cana-de-açúcar, e de 72 cm, solos ocupados com outros usos. A aplicação do índice de tempo de vida revelou que, adotando a profundidade crítica de 50 cm, o tempo de vida médio do solo nas áreas ocupadas com cana-de-açúcar é de 178 anos, e que, mantida a expectativa atual de perdas, pouco mais de 70 anos serão suficientes para degradar o recurso em cerca de 50 % da área cultivada com cana-de-açúcar (meia-vida do solo). Para a profundidade crítica de 100 cm, a situação se agrava, e o tempo de vida médio do solo nas áreas ocupadas com cana-de-açúcar cai para apenas 102 anos e a meia-vida para 42 anos. A aplicação do método possibilitou ainda estimar em cerca de 19 e de 74 % as proporções da área cultivada com cana-de-açúcar em que a atual situação já é de impacto permanente instalado (tempo de vida do solo zero), isto é, locais onde as taxas de perda de solo são superiores à taxa de renovação, e a espessura do solo já é inferior às profundidades críticas consideradas, no caso 50 m e 100 cm, respectivamente. Nas condições atuais de uso e manejo, a situação de conservação de recursos, em particular do solo, pôde ser caracterizada em apenas 7,6 ha ou em menos de 1 % da área com cana-de-açúcar. A taxa de renovação do solo foi superior às taxas estimadas de perdas por erosão. Em mais de 99 % da área ocupada com cana-de-açúcar, portanto, as taxas estimadas de perda de solo por erosão superam a taxa de renovação do solo (p > r), caracterizando a degradação de recursos. O índice proposto mostrou-se uma ferramenta promissora para interpretação da tolerância da perda de solo aplicada ao planejamento do uso agrícola em bases sustentáveis.},

Rela- tionships among gold endowment, shear-zone trend, and geologic complexity, as measured by fractal dimensions, indicate that (1) ore fluids were focused into those parts of the shear zone with greatest misorientation from the regional trend, which define di- lational sites during shearing and became the sites of world-class gold deposits; and (2) the degree of complexity contrast along the shear zone modulated gold endowment.},

  Abstract                 = {The primary objective of this study was to assess the condition of a portion of Saudi Arabia’s rangelands and evaluate the eVects of grazing by the animal herds of indigenous nomads over the last decade. Because of the desertic condition of these rangelands, changes in vegetation cover are more subtle than would be the case for other, less arid areas. Consequently, a new analytic methodo- logy for the detection of desertification of arid and hyper-arid rangelands was developed specifically for this project. The conceptual framework for the analysis is the use of the coe cient of variation (COV) of the monthly Normalized DiVerence Vegetation Index (NDVI, maximum-value composite) as a measure of vegetative biomass change. A higher NDVI COV for a given pixel (excluding cases of changes in land use) represents a greater change in vegetation biomass in the ground area represented by that pixel. Linear regression was used to determine the trend in COV values for each pixel over the 12-year period for which data was available; pixels with a negative slope are considered to represent ground areas with decreasing amounts of vegetation. Results were validated by tests of statistical significance and by comparison of the theoretical results to vegetation change and land-cover data from the remote sensing systems and from reconnaissance fiights over select areas. These desertification trend results were then combined with land-cover information to provide an assessment of desertification status.},

  Abstract                 = {The geostatistical properties of soil moisture patterns from five different sites in Australia (Tarrawarra and Point Nepean) and New Zealand (three sites from the Mahurangi River Basin?Carran?s, Clayden?s and Satellite Station) are analysed here. The soil moisture data were collected using time domain reflectometry and consistent methods for all sites, thereby allowing comparisons to be drawn between sites without the complication of methodological differences. The sites have contrasting climatic and soils characteristics. Soil moisture in the top 30 cm of the soil profile was measured using time domain reflectometry on 6?8 occasions at each site. The variance and correlation structure of the patterns was analysed. Typical correlation scales lie between 30 and 60 m. We found that there was a seasonal evolution in the spatial soil moisture variance that was related to changes in the spatial mean moisture content at all sites. At the Australian sites there was also a seasonal evolution in the correlation length related to changes in the spatial mean moisture, but not at the New Zealand sites. The seasonal evolution of the correlation length in the Australian catchments is likely to be associated with a seasonal change in the processes controlling the soil moisture pattern. The more humid climate at the New Zealand sites leads to more consistent spatial controls over the year. Similarities between the correlation structure of the moisture and topographic indices representing lateral flow and topographically modulated evaporative forcing were found at Tarrawarra, Carran?s and Clayden?s. At Point Nepean the correlation structure of the soil moisture pattern is controlled by a larger (than the topography) scale variation in soils, properties and at Satellite Station a smaller scale source of variability is apparent in the data (although there were also topographical effects apparent, associated with valley features). The results demonstrate that the processes controlling spatial patterns can change between places and over time with catchment moisture status; however, when similar general conditions reoccur in a catchment, similar spatial patterns result. Soil characteristics and climate do provide a general pointer to what we might expect but the results also show subtleties specific to place.},

  Abstract                 = {1. The biases and shortcomings of stepwise multiple regression are well established within the statistical literature. However, an examination of papers published in 2004 by three leading ecological and behavioural journals suggested that the use of this technique remains widespread: of 65 papers in which a multiple regression approach was used, 57% of studies used a stepwise procedure. 2. The principal drawbacks of stepwise multiple regression include bias in parameter estimation, inconsistencies among model selection algorithms, an inherent (but often overlooked) problem of multiple hypothesis testing, and an inappropriate focus or reliance on a single best model. We discuss each of these issues with examples. 3. We use a worked example of data on yellowhammer distribution collected over 4 years to highlight the pitfalls of stepwise regression. We show that stepwise regression allows models containing signi?cant predictors to be obtained from each year?s data. In spite of the signi?cance of the selected models, they vary substantially between years and suggest patterns that are at odds with those determined by analysing the full, 4-year data set. 4. An information theoretic (IT) analysis of the yellowhammer data set illustrates why the varying outcomes of stepwise analyses arise. In particular, the IT approach identi?es large numbers of competing models that could describe the data equally well, showing that no one model should be relied upon for inference.},

  Abstract                 = {The visions, directions, and images of soil science are changing. Historically, soil science has followed a circuitous path in its evolution from a discipline with foundational roots in geology, to an applied agricultural and environmental discipline, and now to a bio- and geo-science through the Earth's Critical Zone investigations. This closes the loop or spiral, but along the way, soil science has become more comprehensive, extensive, integrative, analytical, and quantitative. In spite of the challenges described in this paper, now is a golden era for soil science to integrate its expertise more closely with other bio- and geo-sciences. This will significantly enhance the opportunity to obtain extramural funding and public support, as well as the advancement of soil science. As such, soil science needs to vigorously become more interactive and extend its role beyond traditional agriculture. The knowledge of spatial soil diversity and landscape dynamics is a fundamental underpinning critical to the success of this venture. Pedology, as a unique subdiscipline of soil science, contributes inordinately to Earth science, including, for example, elucidation of field variability, surficial weathering processes, Earth system dynamics, and vadose zone flow and transport. With the blooming of hydrogeosciences, hydropedology is a timely addition in this era of interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and systems approaches for developing comprehensive prioritization of science and applications in Earth science. Hydropedology has a niche in this march with other bio- and geo-sciences in addressing global Earth science priorities. Soil scientists support changing paradigms and favor closer linkages with the bio- and geo-sciences community. In this regard, hydropedology has a unique role to play.},

  Abstract                 = {Airborne gamma-ray spectrometry is a passive remote sensing technique that measures the natural emission of gamma-ray radiation from the upper 30 cm of the earth's surface. The principle gamma-ray emitting isotopes used in airborne geophysical surveys are 40K, and the 232Th and 238U decay series. These are used to estimate potassium, thorium and uranium abundances, respectively. Gamma rays emitted from the earth's surface mainly relate to the mineralogy and geochemistry of the bedrock and weathered materials (e.g. soils, saprolite, alluvial and colluvial sediments). Gamma-ray imagery can thus be regarded as a surface geochemical map showing the distribution of the radionuclides in rocks, regolith and soil. Where the bedrock contains K-bearing minerals, the loss of K in the soil can often be used as a surrogate for mapping the degree of surface weathering and leaching. Potassium is also associated with potassic clays such as illite, and can be found in smaller amounts where it is absorbed onto clays such as montmorillonite and kaolinite. In contrast, U and Th are often associated with more stable weathered constitutes in the soil profile. Uranium and Th released during weathering are readily absorbed onto clay minerals, oxides (Fe and Al) and organic matter in soils. Elevated U and Th can also be associated with resistate minerals. Therefore, Th and U concentrations often increase as K decreases during bedrock weathering and soil formation. In erosional landscapes the gamma-ray response will relate mainly to mineralogy and geochemistry of the bedrock, weathering characteristics and both past and present landscape processes. Responses of soils in depositional landscapes will reflect the geochemistry and mineralogy of the source rocks, or regolith, from which the sediments are derived, and the sorting of the sediments and weathering of the sediments after deposition. In both erosional and depositional landscapes, when the radioelement characteristic of the sources are well understood, gamma-ray data can be used to predict specific soil characteristics and provide information about erosional, depositional and weathering processes},

  Abstract                 = {On upland Triassic sandstone slopes of the western Blue Mountains, nonswamp, sclerophyllous heath (shrub-dominated vegetation) on shallow soils is commonly found downslope and adjacent to sclerophyllous forest on deeper soils. Some consider heath?and thus shallow soils?as favouring west-facing slopes, which are expected to experience drier microclimates due to insolation, strong and desiccating winds, and severe summer fires. However, our analysis of extensive areas with heath on shallow soils, based on vegetation and topographic maps, and fieldwork of uplands with various degrees of dissection, suggests that aspect is a poor predictor of shallow soils. Rather, shallow soils and heath are found on short slopes and the lower segments of longer slopes with the latter significantly steeper than forested segments. The shallow?deep soil boundary, marked by contrasting modern vegetation structures, does not signify a catchment area threshold, and correspondingly, the vegetation patterns are not in balance with distributary catchment processes, as short slopes are mantled exclusively by shallow soils. Instead, the soil depth boundary represents the propagation of base-level lowering signals, which takes place not only by the headward retreat of knickpoints but also via increased lowering of slope segments adjacent to drainage lines. This leads to steep slopes immediately adjacent to canyons, narrow gorges, and small steep valleys, that are mantled by shallow, discontinuous soils undergoing rapid erosion. These steep slopes persist in the landscape for ?10 My after upland stream rejuvenation until incision of more weatherable Permian sediments, underlying the Triassic cliff-forming sandstones, triggers rapid lateral expansion of gorges. Once shallowly mantled and steeper slopes adjacent to streams are consumed by gorge widening, slopes adjacent to wide gorge clifflines reflect former upland drainage patterns rather than the redirected flow to rapidly widening gorges. Hence, modern vegetation patterns reflect a significant phase of landform development, perhaps combined with enhanced erosion during the Last Glacial Period that is compounded by a humped soil production function on bedrock.},

The primary goal is to describe the state-of-the-art for a typical digital terrain modeling workflow that starts with data capture, continues with data preprocessing and DEM generation, and concludes with the calculation of one or more primary and secondary land surface parameters. The article first describes some of ways in which LiDAR and RADAR remote sensing technologies have transformed the sources and methods for capturing elevation data. It next discusses the need for and various methods that are currently used to preprocess DEMs along with some of the challenges that confront those who tackle these tasks. The bulk of the article describes some of the subtleties involved in calculating the primary land surface parameters that are derived directly from DEMs without additional inputs and the two sets of secondary land surface parameters that are commonly used to model solar radiation and the accompanying interactions between the land surface and the atmosphere on the one hand and water flow and related surface processes on the other. It concludes with a discussion of the various kinds of errors that are embedded in DEMs, how these may be propagated and carried forward in calculating various land surface parameters, and the consequences of this state-of-affairs for the modern terrain analyst.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensive regression analyses of basic soil-loss data were designed to determine the best indicator of the capacity of a storm to erode soil. The rainstorm characteristic found to be outstanding as such an indicator is the variable whose value is the product of the rainfall energy and maximum 30-minute intensity of the storm (designated as EI). This variable explained from 72 to 97% of the variation in individual-storm erosion from tilled continuous fallow on 6 soils. Seasonal rainfall erosion index values computed by adding the EI values of storms > 0.5 inch explained as high as 94% of the yearly deviation in total soil loss from fallow during the summer season. Tested against data from plots in continuous row crop for 10 or more years at each of four widely separated locations, the summed EI values explained from 72 to 85% of the yearly variation in soil loss within corresponding cover periods. Expected annual values of the index and seasonal distribution of the erosion potential may be readily computed from local rainfall records. This has been done for 60 locations in the 31 Eastern States. About 8,000 plot-years of basic erosion data are being analyzed to evaluate factors for a universal soil-loss equation for which the erosion potential of expected local rainfall serves as the base. Tests show that estimates of average erosion losses computed in this manner are sufficiently accurate to serve as sound bases for conservation farm planning.},

The work reviewed here represents the first attempt at a systematic theoretical framework for such understanding in the context of surface runoff generation by different processes. The parameterization of hydrological processes over a range of scales is examined, and the concept of the &#8220;representative elementary area&#8221; (REA) is introduced. The REA is a fundamental scale for catchment modeling at which continuum assumptions can be applied for the spatially variable controls and parameters, and spatial patterns no longer have to be considered explicitly. The investigation of scale leads into the concept of hydrologic similarity in which the effects of the environmental controls on runoff generation and flood frequency response be investigated independently of catchment scale. The paper reviews the authors' initial results and hopefully will motivate others to also investigate the issues of hydrologic scale and similarity.},

  Abstract                 = {We have developed interviewing techniques for knowledge elicitation based on (1) relevant research and techniques from the social sciences, (2) the nature of expertise, (3) a desire to assist a knowledge engineer to avoid reductive bias, one of the pitfalls associated with the acquisition of highly complex concepts, and (4) the desirability of de-coupling elicitation from implementation. The approach consists of four phases with guidelines for questions suited to each stage. First, the descriptive elicitation stage is intended to reveal the important entities and concepts in the domain as reflected in the terms and specialized language used by the expert. A second stage, structured expansion, is designed to probe the relationships between the domain concepts and the organization of the expert's knowledge using the terminology uncovered in the previous stage. the scripting phase relies on the declarative knowledge found through the two previous stages to discover procedural knowledge, and the final component, validation, is important throughout the process of knowledge elicitation to ensure that the knowledge being elicited is correct and adequate to enable a system in which it is implemented to solve the class of problems with which it is concerned.},

To compare the spatial variabilities of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations in different soil map unit or combination of soil map units, a total of 94 samples distributed in three map units (Yellowish-red soil, Gravelly-yellowish-red soil and Gritty-yellowish-red soil) were collected in this area. The values of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd concentrations were natural logarithm transformed to fit normal distribution. The variations of four heavy metal concentrations in Gravelly-yellowish-red soil was similar to that in Gritty-yellowish-red soil, but they were different to that in Yellowish-red soil. Then, the 94 soil samples were grouped into two classes (samples of Yellowish-red soil, and samples of Gravelly-yellowish-red soil or Gritty-yellowish-red soil). Semivariogram analysis revealed that all the four heavy metal concentrations in the study area showed moderate to strong spatial dependency, and local spatial variability (i.e. the variance between soil map units) played an important role in their spatial prediction. The spatial distribution maps of the four heavy metals were drawn by using only the measured data and by using the measured data plus taking into account soil map units, respectively. The results showed that spatial prediction by taking into account soil map units could reveal the huge spatial variability of the heavy metals, much better than the prediction without using soil map information in this contaminated site.},

  Abstract                 = {Accurately measuring soil organic matter content (SOM) in paddy fi elds is important because SOM is one of the key soil properties controlling nutrient budgets in agricultural production systems. Estimation of this soil property at an acceptable level of accuracy is important; especially in the case when SOM exhibits strong spatial dependence and its measurement is a timeand labor-consuming procedure. This study was conducted to evaluate and compare spatial estimation by kriging and cokriging with remotely sensed data to predict SOM using limited available data for a 367-km2 study area in Haining City, Zhejiang Province, China. Measured SOM ranged from 5.7 to 40.4 g kg-1, with a mean of 19.5 g kg-1. Correlation analysis between the SOM content of 131 soil samples and the corresponding digital number (DN) of six bands (Band 1?5 and Band 7) of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) imagery showed that correlation between SOM and DN of Band 1 was the highest (r = -0.587). We used the DN of Band 1 as auxiliary data for the SOM prediction, and used descriptive statistics and the kriging standard deviation (STD) to compare the reliabilities of the predictions. We also used crossvalidation to validate the SOM prediction. Results indicate that cokriging with remotely sensed data was superior to kriging in the case of limited available data and the moderately strong linear relationship between remotely sensed data and SOM content. Remotely sensed data such as Landsat ETM imagery have the potential as useful auxiliary variables for improving the precision and reliability of SOM prediction.},

This paper aims to provide an understanding of the effect of soil particle rearrangement on the water retention characteristics in zero gravity. A three-dimensional pore network model is developed to predict water retention characteristics under two forms of particle packing? cubic packing most porous and rhombohedral packing most compact. The pore-throat distributions, as input parameters to the network model, are derived from particle size distribution under the two forms of particle arrangement. The model simulations reveal the quantitative variation of water retention characteristics due to particle rearrangement. Soil particle rearrangement that occurs during the drying process is shown to signi?cantly change the water retention curve when a soil is near saturation. When the soil is near residual water content, the particle rearrangement has little effect on the water retention curve. The model results indicated that an increase in packing density results in decreased water content at saturation, increased bubbling pressure, and accentuated water retention hysteresis. The model also reveals nonuniform spatial distribution of pore ?uid in porous medium in zero gravity. Although this paper studied the soil-water characteristics from the microgravity perspective, its results also contribute to the understanding of the soil-water characteristics due to soil compaction on Earth.},

  Abstract                 = {This package provides a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation in R, which can be used to deal with any type of (plain text) files, including Sweave, HTML, Markdown and reStructuredText. The patterns of code chunks and inline R expressions can be customized. R code is evaluated as if it were copied and pasted in an R terminal thanks to the evaluate package (e.g. we do not need to explicitly print() plots from ggplot2 or lattice). R code can be reformatted by the formatR package so that long lines are automatically wrapped, with indent and spaces being added, and comments being preserved. A simple caching mechanism is provided to cache results from computations for the first time and the computations will be skipped the next time. Almost all common graphics devices, including those in base R and add-on packages like Cairo, cairoDevice and tikzDevice, are built-in with this package and it is straightforward to switch between devices without writing any special functions. The width and height as well as alignment of plots in the output document can be specified in chunk options (the size of plots for graphics devices is still supported as usual). Multiple plots can be recorded in a single code chunk, and it is also allowed to rearrange plots to the end of a chunk or just keep the last plot. Warnings, messages and errors are written in the output document by default (can be turned off). Currently LaTeX, HTML, Markdown and reST are supported, and other output formats can be supported by hook functions. The large collection of hooks in this package makes it possible for the user to control almost everything in the R code input and output. Hooks can be used either to format the output or to run a specified R code fragment before or after a code chunk. The language in code chunks is not restricted to R only (there is simple support to Python and Awk, etc). Many features are borrowed from or inspired by Sweave, cacheSweave, pgfSweave, brew and decumar.},

The objective of this study was to develop a method of determining practical thresholds for erosive rainfall events and to evaluate its effectiveness for calculation of erosivity. Rainfall and runoff data measured for three plots and a small watershed from 1961 to 1969 at the Zizhou experimental station of the Yellow River Basin in China were used. Three thresholds for separating erosive events were given by using different types of rainfall data: (1) 12 mm for storm rainfall amount, (2) 2.4 mm h?1 for average rainfall intensity, and (3) 13.3 mm h?1 for the maximum 30?minute rainfall intensity. All methods had less than 0.1% overall error in the prediction of the erosivity value. Peak intensity provided the greatest accuracy for separating erosive rains, followed by rainfall intensity and then rainfall amount. A total of 79%, 77%, and 88% of the total number of events were omitted from the calculations using rainfall amount, average rainfall intensity, and 30?minute peak intensity, respectively. Any of the above three thresholds may be used according to data availability and desired accuracy of the erosivity estimation.},

Spatial distributions for 13 soil chemical properties and soil texture were examined in a fallow land in Bajgah, Fars province, Iran. Soil samples were collected at approximately 60 m2 at 0-30 cm depth and coordinates of each of the 100 points were recorded with GPS. The spatial distribution and spatial dependence level varied within location. The range of spatial dependence was found to vary within soil parameters. Phosphorous had the shortest range of spatial dependence (49.50 m) and percentage of calcium carbonate equivalent had the longest (181.94 m). All parameters exhibited strongly spatially dependent. The results demonstrate that within the same field, spatial patterns vary among several soil parameters. Soil nutrients were found to be affected by farmer management. Variography and kriging can be useful tools for designing effective soil sampling strategies and variable rate application of inputs for use in site-specific farming.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil N2O emission data is typically highly skewed. In terrain where the spatial distribution of soil processes is controlled by topography, extreme N2O flux events can be highly localized and nonstationary. Wavelet analysis can be used to describe the spatial variation of these nonstationary processes. The objectives of this study were to use wavelet analysis to determine the spatial variation, scales of variability and their change over the snowmelt period for soil N2O flux. On a hummocky, agricultural landscape in the Dark Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan, N2O flux measurements were taken from a 128-point linear transect five times over the spring snowmelt season of 2004. Localized variance was determined using a continuous wavelet transform (Mexican Hat) and the local spectrum was compared with the distribution of fluxes along the transect and the relative elevation. Two spatial patterns of soil N2O emission were revealed. The first was a cyclic, landscape-element-controlled pattern with a scale of variation that ranged between 20 and 60 m. Changes in the spatial scale were due to a shift in importance between landscape elements as sources of peak N2O flux. The second pattern was composed of non-cyclic, localized features that were due to extreme flux events at specific landscape positions. These extreme flux events were not temporally persistent, but represent a large, non-random contribution to mean and variance on the dates they occurred. Sample strategies to capture the full range of soil N2O emission at this site would probably require separate approaches for these two spatial patterns.},

Except in few cases, all considered soil properties showed signi?cant differences among vegetation communities and topographic aspects. The differences may be attributed to leaching and differences in organic matter (carbon) contents within the soil pro?les due to topographic aspect-induced microclimatic differences, re?ecting the response of vegetation communities to the conditions. Soil textural fractions, mainly silt and clay, bulk density, pH, plant available phosphorus, percent base saturation, CEC, and exchangeable base cations generally increased in the Schef?era?Hagenia vegetation community zone. Further studies might be required to fully understand and clarify the in?uence of aspect, topography and vegetation types on soil properties for site-speci?c soil resource management practices in this mountainous area.},

The overall mean SOC and total N stocks to a depth of 1.0m varied from 35.13 to 44.97kg C m ? 2 and 2.90 to 3.75kg N m ? 2 among aspects. Topographic aspect induced microclimatic differences and vegetation community types were found to be important factors for the significant variations in SOC and total N stocks in the Bale Mountains. About 45% of the SOC stock in the 0?1.0m layer of the mineral soil was held in the top 0.3m of the soil, indicating the potentially large amount of CO 2 that can be released from the top surface soils when these vegetations are deforested and converted into grazing and cultivation.},

  Abstract                 = {A new parameter, here termed openness, expressing the degree of dominance or enclosure of a location on an irregular surface, is developed to visualize topographic character. Openness is an angular measure of the relation between surface relief and horizontal distance. For angles less than 90°, it is equivalent to the internal angle of a cone, its apex at a DEM location, constrained by neighboring elevations within a specified radial distance. Openness incorporates the terrain line-of-sight, or viewshed, concept and is calculated from multiple zenith and nadir angles-here along eight azimuths. Openness has two viewer perspectives. Positive values, expressing openness above the surface, are high for convex forms, whereas negative values describe this attribute below the surface and are high for concave forms. Openness values are mapped by gray-scale tones. The emphasis of terrain convexity and concavity in openness maps facilitates the interpretation of landforms on the Earth's surface and its seafloor, and on the planets, as well as features on any irregular surface-such as those generated by industrial procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {The key Soil Taxonomy is based upon the idea that certain properties can be used to define populations of soils from the soil continuum. The soil mapping paradigm is that similar soil populations exist within landforms. High taxonomic variability has been reported within numerous soil mapping units. The hypotheses in this paper are that for large scale mapping (i) Soil Taxonomy creates classes that are only partially related to landform and (ii) more homogeneous soil classes exist if different defining constructs are used. The objectives are to: (i) classify a sampling of soils within a 40-ha upland pasture using both Soil Taxonomy and cluster analysis, (ii) identify the distinctness and relationships of these samples to landforms, and (iii) compare the geographic distributions of soil classes identified by Soil Taxonomy and cluster analyses. Ninety-four soil properties were measured from 257 pedons along point transects. Cluster analysis identified three pedologically and geographically distinct groups. A single cluster group was identified for soils within the ?ridge? landform, whereas the ?backslope? landform was a mixture of all three groups. A significant relationship was found for soil attributes and slope profile curvature within the backslope landform, but predictive value was low. Soil Taxonomy produced 13 geographically indistinct classes that were partially related to cluster groupings. Cluster analysis appears to be useful for revealing patterns of soil homogeneity and for identifying relationships among soil properties and landforms. Numerical analysis may be a helpful supplementary method for correlating soil surveys with large soil databases, or for defining those soil attributes which distinguish mappable bodies from the soil continuum.},

Twelve randomly selected transects were used to sample soil properties and classify pedons within a fluvial map unit of the Boone County, Missouri, soil survey. Map unit taxonomic variability was high, with 28 taxonomic family classes. Twenty-five percent of the sampled soils were in the named taxonomic class of the map unit, but most were similar inclusions. Interpretive purity of the sample was 83%. Variances about this sample proportion were calculated using three methods: (i) simple random sampling, (ii) cluster sampling, and (iii) two-stage random sampling. The simple random sampling formula provided the smallest variance, compared with the cluster formula (55% larger) or the two-stage formula (72% larger). However, the interpretation of transect sampling as simple random sampling is questioned. The two-stage random sampling method seemed most conceptually correct, but is computationally intensive and requires questionable assumptions about the population size. Confidence intervals based on small sample sizes drawn from binomial populations are highly suspect, and perhaps should be referred to as ?approximate bounds?. It is important to carefully consider the assumptions and effects of any statistical technique chosen to analyze map unit composition.},

  Abstract                 = {Soil organic carbon (SOC) is of great importance in the global carbon cycle. Distribution patterns of SOC in various regions of China constitute a nation-wide baseline for studies on soil carbon changes. This paper presents an integrated and multi-level study on SOC stock patterns of China, and presents baseline SOC stock estimates by great administrative regions, river watersheds, soil type regions and ecosystem. The assignment is done by means of a recently completed 1: 1,000,000 scale soil database of China, which is the most detailed and reliable one in China at the present time. SOC densities of 7292 soil profiles collected across China in the middle of the 1980s were calculated and then linked to corresponding polygons in a digital soil map, resulting in a SOC Density Map of China on a 1: 1,000,000 scale, and a 1km1 km grid map. Corresponding maps of administrative regions, river watersheds, soil types (ST), and ecosystems in China were also prepared with an identical resolution and coordinate control points, allowing GIS analyses. Results show that soils in China cover an area of 9.281106km2 in total, with a total SOC stock of 89.14 Pg (1 Pg ? 1015 g) and a mean SOC density of 96.0 t C/ha. Confidence limits of the SOC stock and density in China are estimated as [89.23 Pg, 89.08 Pg] and [96.143 t C/ha, 95.981 t C/ha] at 95% probability, respectively. The largest total SOC stock (23.60 Pg) is found in South-west China while the highest mean SOC density (181.9 t C/ha) is found in north-east China. The total SOC stock and the mean SOC density in the Yangtze river watershed are 21.05 Pg and 120.0 t C/ha, respectively, while the corresponding figures in theYellow river watershed are 8.46 Pg and 104.3 t C/ha, respectively. The highest total SOC stocks are found in Inceptisols (34.39 Pg) with SOC density of 102.8 t C/ha. The lowest and highest mean SOC densities are found on Entisols (28.1 t C/ha), and on Histosols (994.728.1 t C/ha), repectively. Finally, the total SOC stock in shrub and forest ecosystem classes are 25.55 and 21.50 Pg, respectively; the highest mean SOC density (209.9 t C/ha) was recorded in the wetland ecosystem class and the lowest (29.0 t C/ha) in the desert ecosystem class. Among five forest ecosystem types, Evergreen conifer forest stores the highest SOC stock (6.81 Pg), and Deciduous conifer forest shows the highest SOC density (225.9 t C/ha). Figures of SOC stocks stratified by Administrative regions, river watersheds, soil types and ecosystem types presented in the study may constitute national-wide baseline for studies of SOC stock changes in various regions in the future.},

  Abstract                 = {As mudanças na utilização das terras podem levar à degradação da qualidade química e física do solo. Nas áreas de encosta do estado do Rio Grande do Sul (RS) a vulnerabilidade à degradação das terras é elevada, devido a combinação de relevo forte ondulado a montanhoso e solos com pequena profundidade efetiva. O objetivo geral deste trabalho foi avaliar as características químicas e físicas do solo de áreas situadas no Rebordo do Planalto na região central do RS, sob diferentes usos da terra. Para isso foram selecionadas duas áreas representativas da região denominada Rebordo do Planalto, caracterizada por áreas de encosta com predomínio da agricultura familiar em pequena escala (Silveira Martins (SM) e São João do Polêsine (SJ)) e uma área de transição entre o Rebordo do Planalto e o Planalto Médio (Júlio de Castilhos (JC)). Em SM foram coletadas amostras de solo no sistema de plantio direto (PD), plantio convencional (PC), reflorestamento (RF) e mata nativa (MN). Em SJ foram coletadas amostras de solo sob os usos na mata nativa (MN), mata secundária (MS), lavoura velha (LV), lavoura nova (LN) e lavoura abandonada (LA). Em JC as amostras foram coletadas em áreas de mata nativa (MN), campo nativo (CN) e plantio direto (PD). As amostras foram coletadas na profundidade de 0-10 e 10-20 cm. Através dos resultados obtidos, observaram-se modificações nas características químicas e físicas do solo em função dos diferentes usos da terra, ao comparar com a mata nativa. Em sistemas que não recebem adições constantes de fontes externas, ocorreu uma depressão da fertilidade química. A matéria orgânica do solo teve diminuição nos teores, conforme aumentou a intensidade de uso da terra. O grupo C-O-alquil foi o grupo de carbono que apresentou a maior contribuição nos espectros de RMN 13 C, independente do sistema de uso da terra. As principais alterações físicas ocorridas em comparação com as condições naturais do solo, foram diminuições da macroporosidade, porosidade total e condutividade hidráulica saturada e aumento na densidade do solo. Os parâmetros de agregação do solo, neste trabalho, não se mostraram como bons índices de avaliação para identificar mudanças em função dos diferentes usos da terra.},

To evaluate its environmental quality, a total of 166 surface soil sam- ples (0e10 cm depth) were collected from parks and grasslands at the density of 1 sample per 0.25 km2 at the end of 2004. All samples were analysed using ICP-AES for the near-total concentrations of 26 chemical elements. Multivariate statistics and GIS techniques were applied to classify the elements and to identify elements influenced by human activities. Cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) classified the elements into two groups: the ?rst group predominantly derived from natural sources, the second being in?uenced by human activities. GIS mapping is a powerful tool in identifying the possible sources of pollutants. Relatively high concentrations of Cu, Pb and Zn were found in the city centre, old residential areas, and along major traf?c routes, showing signifficant effects of traffic pollution. The element As is enriched in soils of the old built-up areas, which can be attributed to coal and peat combustion for home heating. Such signifficant spatial patterns of pollutants displayed by urban soils may imply potential health threat to residents of the contaminated areas of the city.},

The age of the soil profiles was dated by both archaeological and 14 C chronological methods. The results showed that urban soils in the old commercial/workshop quarter of Nanjing were generally contaminated by heavy metals Cu, Zn, Pb, but their concentration levels varied significantly among the cultural layers formed in different dynasties. The substantial increase of heavy metals appeared in three historical periods, i.e., South Dynasty (222?589 AD), the earlier Ming (1368?1644AD) and the late Qing (1644?1912AD) in one area. The tremendous input and storage of heavy metals in soils was explained by the primitive smelting and the strengthened metal processing activities, which might be due to the requirement of weapon making or other industries, in the changing social conditions of the corresponding periods. Soils in the once noble political, cultural centers did not show significant increase of heavy metals. The difference in the distribution pattern of heavy metals revealed the contrasting history of the site uses. The change of contaminant level in soils is believed to be a reflection of various human activities in the city during the past 20 centuries.},

This study was conducted to evaluate the overall performance of the Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) hillslope model in predicting runoff and soil loss under cropped conditions. Natural runoff plot data, including 4,124 selected events 556 plot years, and 34 cropping scenarios, from eight locations were selected. The average length of record for the cropping scenarios was about nine years. Several common crops and tillage systems were included. The WEPP input files for soil, slope, climate, and crop management were compiled based on measured data. The coefficient of determination (r2) between model-predicted and measured-runoff volumes for optimized Green and Ampt hydraulic conductivity (Kb) was 0.77 for selected events, 0.76 for annual values, and 0.87 for average annual values; the r2 between predicted and measured soil losses (excluding fallow and corn plots at Bethany, Mo.) was 0.36, 0.60, and 0.85, respectively. Similar predictions of runoff and soil loss were also obtained with WEPP internally estimated Kb values. Runoff and soil loss were slightly overpredicted for small storms and for years with low runoff and soil loss rates, and were underpredicted for large storms and for years with high runoff and soil loss rates. However, average runoff and soil loss rates for different cropping and management systems were adequately predicted. The accuracy and reliability of the predictions were shown to improve from an event to annual to average annual basis. Results of this study show that the WEPP model is a useful tool for predicting runoff and soil loss rates under cropped conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Chinese fir is an important timber species in Southern China. Millions of hectares of Chinese fir plantations have been established during the past decades, and increasing areas are re-planted as second or later rotations. Since the 1980s, scientists and forest managers have reported apparent yield decline and soil fertility degradation over successive rotations. If this yield decline is accompanied by a reduction in carbon stocks, and if it is caused by management, it has to be considered as a form of forest degradation and will become important from a carbon-accounting point of view. In this paper we have collected and compiled published data relevant to growth and soil properties over successive rotations of Chinese fir, calculated the stocks of stand biomass and soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and have analyzed the impact on carbon stocks of growing Chinese fir over successive rotations. We found that on an average, stand biomass increments were reduced by 24% from the first to the second rotation, and by a further 40% from the second to the third rotation. Soil organic carbon was reduced by 10% and 15% between the first and second, and second and third rotations, respectively. Soil carbon losses were usually accompanied by nitrogen losses but carbon losses were generally larger than nitrogen losses. The reduction of carbon stocks in successive rotations appears to be related to increases in soil bulk density and nutrient losses caused by burning of residues during site preparation. Potential afforestation/reforestation projects under the clean development mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol may also need to consider the possible yield decline and soil degradation over successive rotations of plantations.},

  Abstract                 = {Conventional classification systems based on vegetation and land use are frequently used to characterize or describe urban soils to determine the influence of urbanization on soils. In this study, the sensitivity of different grouping methods in reflecting soil variations along an urban-rural gradient was compared. The objective of this study was to determine the most sensitive grouping system in depicting and explaining variations of soil attributes around an urban area. Grouping methods, including urban-rural division, in situ vegetation type, land use types in different scales and numerical clustering, were compared for both single soil attributes and #soil##set# defined by multiple variables. The result shows urbanization has a strong impact on many soil properties, especially that of gravel content, sand content, pH, phosphorus and soil compaction. In terms of the variations of soil attributes, in situ vegetation type is the most sensitive in comparison with local land use types and district-viewed land use types. In other words, soil properties in this study are not sensitive to coarser spatial resolution. Therefore, it's hard to interpret the spatial variation of urban soil by regular methods using natural soil-landscape paradigm. Furthermore, vegetation would best proxy the delineation of single attribute of urban soils. Numerical clusters effectively reflect the land use types and their change during urbanization. All clusters were interpreted as different sets with practical meanings: soil in abandoned greenbelt, soil in ill-managed greenbelt, soil in new vegetable land, extreme urban conditioned soil, soil in well-managed greenbelt, soil in highly mellowed vegetable land, soil in common urban-peri-urban greenbelt and weak-urban-impacted soil. They can be used as bases for soil regionalization in urban and peri-urban environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Fuzzy membership function is an effective tool to represent relationship between soil and environment for predictive soil mapping. Usually construction of a fuzzy membership function requires knowledge on soil- landscape relationships obtained from local soil experts or from extensive field samples. For areas with no soil survey experts and no extensive soil field observations, a purposive sampling approach could provide the descriptive knowledge on the relationships. However, quantifying this descriptive knowledge in the form of fuzzy membership functions for predictive soil mapping is a challenge. This paper presents a method to construct fuzzy membership functions using descriptive knowledge. Construction of fuzzy membership functions is accomplished based on two types of knowledge: 1) knowledge on typical environmental conditions of each soil type and 2) knowledge on how each soil type corresponds to changes in environmental conditions. These two types of knowledge can be extracted from catenary sequences of soil types and the associated environment information collected at a few field samples through purposive sampling. The proposed method was tested in a watershed located in Heshan farm of Nenjiang County in Heilongjiang Province of China. A set of membership functions were constructed to represent the descriptive knowledge on soil-landscape relationships, which were derived from 22 field samples collected through a purposive sampling approach. A soil subgroup map and an A-horizon soil organic matter content map for the area were generated using these membership functions. Forty five field validation points were collected independently to evaluate the two soil maps. The soil subgroup map achieved 76% of accuracy. The A-horizon soil organic matter content map based on the derived fuzzy membership functions was compared with that derived from a multiple linear regression model. The comparison showed that the soil organic content map based on fuzzy membership functions performed better than the soil map based on the linear regression model. The proposed method could also be used to construction membership functions from descriptive knowledge obtained from other sources.},

  Abstract                 = {U is known that the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test is strongly influenced by unequal variances of treatment groups combined with unequal sample sizes. This simulation study indicates that, for various continuous and discrete distributions, the discrepancy between the empirical Type I en-or tale and the nominal significance level is large even when sample sizes arc equal. In some cases, it exceeds the similar discrepancy characteristic of the Student t test. Furthermore. Cur some distributions, the discrepancy becomes increasingly more extreme as sample sizes increase. When sample sizes are relatively large, so that the normal-approximation form of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is appropriate, minor and usually undetected differences in variability of treatment groups can substantially inflate the Type I error rate. For several distributions, including some that occur frequently in psychological research, ratios of population standard deviations as small as I .1 or 1.2 have sizeable effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Evaluating the effects of different soil and crop management practices on soil loss is largely based on soil erosion plot experiments. However, most soil erosion plots in developing countries are simple, low-cost installations. Runoff and soil loss are sampled manually, and their accuracy depends on the sampling procedures adopted and the diligence of the field staff. A laboratory in Kenya compared the manual sampling accuracy of field staff in charge of erosion plots at the Steep Lands Research Station of the University of Nairobi. The runoff volume was generally slightly under-estimated, but sampling accuracy was acceptable for manual sampling; the mean square error was 5.6%, with a range of 3.6-6.7%. Marked differences between the performances of the field staff were not observed. However, the accuracy of soil loss measurements varied significantly. The mean square sampling errors ranged from 4.7 to 83.0%, with an average of 41.3%, unacceptably poor accuracy. Only two of the five field staff participating in the tests produced acceptable results. To ensure adequate sampling performance, appropriate sampling methods should be designed, training of field staff in sampling techniques should be provided, and regular performance testing should be implemented.},

  Abstract                 = {The aim of this work is to obtain an expression using multiple lineal regressions (MLR) to evaluate environmental soil quality. We used four forest soils from Alicante province (SE Spain), comprising three Mollisols and one Entisol, developed under natural vegetation with minimum human disturbance, considered as reference soils of high quality. We carried out MLR integrating different soil physical, chemical and biochemical properties, and we searched those regressions with Kjeldahl nitrogen (N k ), soil organic carbon (SOC) or microbial biomass carbon (MBC) as predicted parameter. We observed that Mollisols and Entisols presented different relationships among their properties. Thus, we searched different equations for both groups of soils. The selected equation for Mollisols was N ? 0:448 ð P Þ þ 0:017 ð water holding capacity Þ þ 0:410 ð phosphatase Þ  0:567 ð urease Þ þ 0:001 ð MBC Þ þ 0:410 ð b  glucosidase Þ  0:980; and for the Entisol SOC ? 4:247 ð P Þ þ 8:183 ð b  glucosidase Þ  7:949 ð urease Þ þ 17:333: Equations were applied to samples from two forest soils in advanced degree of degradation, one for Mollisols and the other one for the Entisol. We observed a clear deviation in the predicted parameters values related to the real properties. The obtained results show that MLR is a good tool for soil quality evaluation, because it seems to be capable of reflecting the balance among its properties, as well as deviations from it.},

  Abstract                 = {There has been considerable expansion in the use of digital soil mapping technologies and development of methodologies that improve digital soil mapping at all scales and levels of resolution. These developments have occurred in all parts of the world in the past few years and also in countries where it was previously absent. There is almost always a shortage of data in soil research and its applications and this may lead to unsupported statements, poor statistics, misrepresentations and ultimately bad resource management. In digital soil mapping, maximum use is made of sparse data and this book contains useful examples of how this can be done. This book focuses on digital soil mapping methodologies and applications for areas where data are limited, and has the following sections (i) introductory papers, (ii) dealing with limited spatial data infrastructures, (iii) methodology development, and (iv) examples of digital soil mapping in various parts of the globe (including USA, Brazil, UK, France, Czech Republic, Honduras, Kenya, Australia). The final chapter summarises priorities for digital soil mapping.},
